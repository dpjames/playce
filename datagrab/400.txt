In both situations, I was lucky to work with Miles (one of the geniuses at Apple)! Miles has been very educational and has outlined my options in both cases to where I feel as informed as possible when making decisions. \n\nIt's really important to me that I can trust someone with anything that I would purchase at apple, whether its my phone or my laptop.

More interested in flipping chairs quickly for billing purposes than caring about their patients (and it shows).\nIt had been a while since my last cleaning because I didn't have a dentist in this area, and so my cleaning took a while longer than usual. The poor hygienist was doing a thorough job and told me why it was taking her longer, which I totally understood and I appreciated her efforts.\nUnfortunately, every 3 minutes a lady who I assume was the office manager kept coming by asking her how much longer, and to please hurry up! The hygienist repeatedly told her that it would not be much longer, but that she needed to reach some areas that were tough. A minor argument ensued while I was sitting there with my mouth hanging open. \nI felt sorry for the hygienist because she was very conscientious about her work and wanted to do a good job, but evidently she was holding up the assembly line by doing so.\nThen the topper of the whole experience came a week or so later when I had to go back for some dental work. They kept me in the office lobby waiting for 50 minutes past my appointment time, and then the office manager came out (after the lobby was empty), and said that she needed to inform me that she called my insurance carrier and that my price was now double!\nWhy she called the carrier, and why she waited until the time of my appointment to do so is beyond me. So there I am, waiting to go in and get a couple of cavities filled, and she comes out and says that I now need to pay $800 right then! I said I'd get back to her, and that I wasn't getting the work done that day. You should have seen the look on her face, like I'd passed gas or something. \nAnd the funny part is that I was complaining about this later to a family member and she told me that they did the EXACT same thing to her! Except they actually had her in the chair with her mouth numb and waiting for the Dr. to do a root canal, and the office/account manager came up to her chair and told her that the insurance billing was changed and that she owed them double what they had told her, and that she needed to make payment arrangements immediately. WHILE SHE WAS IN THE CHAIR!\nI have since read the reviews on this dentist and the SAME complaints are repeated over and over again, and they all sound like they experienced the same \"bait and switch\" tactics I did. They quote you a price, then come back at the very last minute and raise it.\n\nIf you're looking for a caring, family-oriented dentist who won't treat you like a billing-number, this is not the dentist you want to go to.....seriously.","time":1392146457}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["dentist","health","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=499057878429221603","utc_offset":-480,"vicinity":"1551

I asked him a couple of questions, and he answered by saying, \"Well if you'll stop talking long enough  I will explain it to you.\"  I have NEVER had anyone say this to me.  Dr. Lonsbrough, you should not speak to your patients that way!!  Don't forget that we are paying for your nice car and home....

However, when we arrived, we were greeted by Chad who was busy helping another customer. No problem! When Chad was finished with the other customer we expected to be helped out with a friendly smile and also expected to be spoken to with respect, asked questions about our project (which happens to be a $200k remodel) and shown other light fixtures which we might need (we need a ton!). Bottom line is that Chad is not friendly, not helpful and like another review on YP says, \"Acropolis chooses its customers\". I guess we didn't fit the bill. My wife, son and myself all felt very uncomfortable the entire time. We purchased a 20' piece of wire for $60.00 (ripoff) and I have re-wired the fixtures myself. \n\nI gave the company 3 stars as opposed to 1 because the selection is terrific and I assume that not all of the people who work here are as entitled and childish as Chad.

The Gasoline lines move rather quickly and the parking is always open and available. I usually arrive around 9:40 A.M. to fuel up and then I am one of the first customers when the front doors open. The store layout and lighting are great with several associates working to help you. The prices and selections are very competitive, and the Samples in the later hours are a great opportunity to see if you like or dislike a product. The checkout process moves along quickly and I enjoy chatting with the associates who always offer me Boxes for my items and help out if needed.

There was also a $7 miscellaneous charge which I am unsure of the cause. \n\nAs far as customer service goes, 10/10.

I have been deathly afraid to go to the dentist for over 20 years. I only went when I was in severe pain. Not anymore! Dr. Murphy put me at ease on my first visit and I've been back every 6 months since. He works quickly, yet is very thorough. I'm always surprised by how fast my appointments go. I know I won't ever have any more issues with my teeth with Dr. Murphy!  EVERYONE in the office is so friendly. Cambria, my hygienist, is the best! She gets me in and out for my cleanings with ease. I actually look forward to my appointments now because of the professionals in this office. I can't say enough good things about this practice. They are hands down the best dental practice around.","time":1515707446},{"author_name":"nicole cassingham","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110620890082123252603/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5wjd1FAHNbg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/d8PsgCr7unU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"This place is the best I’ve found in the SLO area.
