They never bothered to read my written testimony (I have a medical condition due to the assault which has left me with horrible memory/concentration problems), they never attempted to contact my witnesses (they had a direct interaction with the suspect and elements of the assault were discussed between them), and they disregarded my other pieces of evidence (including my medical record). They let the case sit for about three months, and whoever was supposed to work my case (I didn't even know who was working my case at the time) was difficult to communicate with. On top of that, they made a lot of \"police opinion\" about the situation, my relation to the suspect, and my conditions during and after the assault. These assumptions were the very thing that stalled and ultimately ruined my case. They told me that they only have 5 detectives working \"hundreds of cases\" as an excuse. However, this does not excuse negligence. They need to either hire more detectives or hire detectives with a higher work ethic. Very disappointed with this department.\n\nUpdate: I filed a citizen's complaint and the department is now taking the case much more seriously. I don't want to think about how many people might have been in my situation and never received the attention they needed.

school isn't for everyone, perhaps you included. you are wrong to write such nonsense in a public forum. your comments are inaccurate, indefensible, misinformed, and outlandish.\n\nfollowing up, Linger...whoops! did you not notice the lesbian couples whose kids attend our school? the non-believers? the folks who go to church elsewhere? lots of those folks are coming back, too. new families are joining us. the application process is incomplete, but it looks certain that attendance will be up from last year. \n\nI didn't bother stating my own opinion about the school since it was implied by my family's continued commitment to the school that we love it. we love that those lesbians and non-believers and other church attenders love it too. and they do. they are all our friends, and I love it that they are our friends. I'm honored that they call me their friend.\n\nI am truly sad the school didn't work for you. indeed I am. but in seeing your willingness to defame the school, I also am happy to declare to the world on this review that you really have little idea of which you speak.\n\nthe floor is yours. I'll give you the last word & let others decide if they should or should not look into our school. I'm biased toward our school and my ability to persuade...I believe I am in the lead on this one.","time":1339992039},{"author_name":"Erik Blaze","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102535513571206834621/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KmtxxwAI1lU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7k/rDZwGUl6_Xw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"San Luis Obispo Classical Academy is where I wish I had gone to school.

They consistently make hasty choices without parent and teacher feedback. What began as a beautiful idea is now crumbling. School has gotten too much of an EGO and has forgotten their way. Instead of driving children to love learning, they are cramming over-the-top, highly cerebral curriculum down their throats. They have also done away with their anti-bully model and allow terrible things to happen to other children without recourse. Great teachers do happen to be here if you're lucky enough to get one that has stayed on for more than 2 years. The turn around is ridiculous. My child had two new teachers come in mid-year two years in a row! Parents are exhausted with all that is being asked of them and now they decide to raise tuition? Crazy!\n@Bischbubba: Apparently, the review tool of this public forum whizzed by your comprehension. From my understanding it is completely fair and valuable for me to give my honest feedback of this school. In fact, as a classical educating parent at SLOCA, you should already know the context from where the word \"forum\" is derived from. If not, let me jog your mind...Ancient Greece and Rome...the 6th. century BCE...Aristotle, Socrates, Plato? It's interesting to me that you would find my opinion wrong or invaluable. I can only thank you for sharing your opinion and be glad that this school worked out for you. I thank you also for reinforcing with your rhetoric exactly the kind of egocentric baloney that goes in tandem with SLOCA. It seems as though this school is beginning to unravel. However, I'm sure it can survive as a perfect school for cookie-cutter, same church going, narrow thinking individuals. Heaven forbid you have an opinion or thought of your own to share!","time":1338054360},{"author_name":"Kelsey

They went out of their way to meet my schedule, answer general questions, answer particular questions about the property, and get everything done promptly. Hal has given me great advice (and no pressure to follow it). Melody is amazing at getting things done almost immediately. The entire team has been more helpful than I could have imagined.

We were looking for a one month spot. This park does not do over night sites. The park is small, quaint and cute. You have to go in and talk to the manager directly, he had paper applications for you to fill out and he will then interview you. You need to apply  in advance, it is hit or miss with getting openings. We are applying for next winter. I liked the manager, he is very helpful. The parking is very very tight so I would advise for those who are super ninja trailer parkers only.","time":1515353192},{"author_name":"Cindy Williams","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105216702962552664666/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3tT4W_KXDpQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT6eeP4NU8_RhpqjENBLyc8mBq0mRw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Perfect","time":1510024029},{"author_name":"Javier Gonzalez","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111292877792683107459/reviews","language":"es","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-z7pgRqpnv7s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAALdI/T92IltdHHj0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Buen servicio.

There are a half dozen or so roofers certified to do the roofing project I needed and I called well over a dozen times over a two week time period.  About one third of the times I actually talked to a receptionist and would be promised a call back by a roofer / and or estimator. Everytime I got ahold of a live person (as many times I had to leave voicemails or just hang up and call back), I was told that a roofer would call me later that day or the following day.  When I would wait until the following day and the times I talked to a receptionist  I received that same \"someone will be in touch with you by tomorrow\".  Twice I was given a four hour time window to meet with an estimator (after the many attempts) and no one ever showed up. One of the most unprofessional construction / roofers I've ever had to deal with as they took a considerable amount of my time be not being upfront saying their either too busy or uncoordinated enough to do my job (which was a $10,000++ Job). Being the summer season, I lost out on a chance w/two different roofers to get the job done as they became too busy.  I kept trying to make it work with Quaglino's as they quoted me about a 10% cheaper price, but in retrospect I think they were just stringing me along with a cheaper quote to see if they lost another job and then could fit me in ( and possibly charge me more add ons later).  I would honestly not bother wasting my time with them.  Now I'm searching for a roofer and many are too busy as I should have realized that if something seems too good, it probably is.

Our little 2 year old was injured on his second day of daycare at this school.  We do not know how it happened because the supervisors on staff all claimed to had not seen him fall & we were never notified when his head began to swell (due to the injury).  I picked him up promptly after my workday ended and I found him with a swollen head (horrifyingly-so, in my opinion as his mother).  I called it to the attention of his teacher and asked her what happened.  It seemed like it was the first time she was noticing that he looked odd.  After asking a bunch of questions about if he fell, or if he was bit by a spider (which she did confirm they had a problem with), or what he ate, I rushed down the street to the ER at Sierra Vista.\n\nAfter waiting quite a while in the ER to get seen we finally had a CT scan done and it turned out he had a skull fracture and a subdural hematoma.  After all this, I have to say we were very lucky that he was not fatally or permanently injured.  The police & CPS were both notified and are conducting their investigation of the childcare facility.  \n\nWhile we as parents recognize and accept that accidents happen (especially with toddlers), it is our responsibility to also inform other parents so they can provide the best care for their children.  I really believe the school didn't intentionally hurt our baby, but he was also unsupervised and even neglected (to the degree that they didn't see his head swelling) for some time.\n\nPlease help spread the word to anyone who is going to or thinking about going to this preschool.\n\nThanks!\n\nP.S.

Lackadaisical park manager when it comes to park maintenance or residents needs. Loud parties at clubhouse going on late into the night without constraint past cut-off times.
