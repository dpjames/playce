She was gentle and considerate of the delicate nature of my situation and did everything she could to make the process as smooth and easy as could be.  She accommodated our meeting with less than 24 hours notice, was prepared and explained everything in a straight forward and non-pushy way.  Their selection of products was far more extensive than I had expected and they absolutely did what they said they would do.

I promised them at MZR Fitness that when I hit my short term goal of losing 20 lbs, that I would write a review online for them so I here I am because I just hit my target yesterday. As cliche' as it sounds to say this, it really is the truth that I could not have done it without the help of MZR Fitness. These guys there really know their stuff especially Mike. I've just never been around so much positive & motivating energy in a gym before. They held me accountable every step of the way and I just love coming there and I look forward to it every single workout. \n\nAnd lastly, I debated on whether I should address one of the previously posted messages by \"sportymeg5 \" but I can't help it and I have to say something. All that I'm going to say is that I think that whomever this person was should keep their negative comments to themselves. If you don't have anything nice to say, then dont say anything.

I have learned more about myself and the practices of yoga, breathing, grounded centeredness that all my previous yoga experience prior, which spans like 20 years +.  For this I am truly, deeply grateful!  The experience has open my eyes and my heart to new forms of practice and ways of being that I had not previously considered.

Sierra Vista Hospital is a hero for my family on many occasions. 8 years ago I almost died of viral meningitis it was Sierra Vista Hospital who properly diagnosed, treated me, and saved my life after another local hospital in a nearby Town diagnosed me as being drunk. When my daughter broke her collarbone we came here. When my son broke his foot we came here. Sierra Vista Hospital takes treating children very seriously and we are always seen quickly. 2 months ago my son almost died from a twisted intestine. Sierra Vista Hospital revived him and sustained his life. They quickly got him transferred to Valley Children's Hospital buy helicopter where he had emergency surgery to remove 2 feet of his intestines. Sierra Vista saved his life and they knew what to do even though they didn't know his diagnosis. With distended bowels they were not able to see what was going on but they knew who to contact. They acted quickly which was so vital because his body had gone septic. Without medical intervention we would have lost him. I also have to give credit to a wonderful woman who I call our guardian angel who is outside the emergency room at the time. She was working for San Luis ambulance and saw that I needed help getting him in. I knew she had quickly evaluated him in her mind and saw how critical he was because she quickly took him to a bed where every staff member in the ER dropped what they were doing to work on him. I cannot say how blessed we are that we came to Sierra Vista. Yesterday my youngest daughter got her finger caught in the hinge of my van door. The tip of her finger was falling off. When we got to Sierra Vista and they saw me holding my daughter wrapped in a towel they got me to a bed in less than a minute. They numbed her hand without putting her out and she fell asleep during the stitches. Sierra Vista Hospital did a wonderful job of stitching her up and handling the situation. They went out of their way to make it easy for me and her. The kindness of the doctors and nurses is unmatchable. Thank you Sierra Vista!","time":1501111237},{"author_name":"John Chesney","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104355565948816095779/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WY2dMn0Px8o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAqXU/ZqwAp7jnyJc/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Lot of confusion on part on of the nurse.

I liked working out here, and the classes were ok, but they were often cancelled because of lack of attendance.  What really displeased me was cancelling my membership.  I had a year-long contract, and I stayed at the gym for the whole year.  When the contract expired, I thought my membership would end, but it didn't; I was moved to a month-to-month membership.  That was my fault for not reading the fine print on the contract, and I was ok with that.  What really upset me was that in order to end the month-to-month membership, I had to pay a 30 dollar cancellation fee, in addition to one additional month.

She said too bad no refund. Well I didn't stop there asked for management she said they are gone , asked for name snipping she was said Patty, I said Patty's last name? She rolled her eyes and said Frost but no use because they won't be back until next week. If anyone has an issue with Shell best to call corporate they were on it right away. I still like Shell gas stations just not this one.","time":1467155617},{"author_name":"Steven Federico","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116957827124579497694/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-b1vsyERH60Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/tlUFf8RpK9g/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"","time":1497137554}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["gas_station","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=10731993357583562474","utc_offset":-480,"vicinity":"11590 Los Osos Valley Road, San Luis Obispo","website":"http://www.shell.us/motorist/gas-station-near-me.html?id=10008307&modeselected=true","html_attributions":[]},{"address_components":[{"long_name":"283","short_name":"283","types":["street_number"]},{"long_name":"Madonna Road","short_name":"Madonna Rd","types":["route"]},{"long_name":"San Luis Obispo","short_name":"San Luis Obispo","types":["locality","political"]},{"long_name":"San Luis Obispo County","short_name":"San Luis Obispo County","types":["administrative_area_level_2","political"]},{"long_name":"California","short_name":"CA","types":["administrative_area_level_1","political"]},{"long_name":"United States","short_name":"US","types":["country","political"]},{"long_name":"93405","short_name":"93405","types":["postal_code"]},{"long_name":"5432","short_name":"5432","types":["postal_code_suffix"]}],"adr_address":"<span class=\"street-address\">283 Madonna Rd</span>, <span class=\"locality\">San Luis Obispo</span>, <span class=\"region\">CA</span> <span class=\"postal-code\">93405-5432</span>, <span class=\"country-name\">USA</span>","formatted_address":"283 Madonna Rd, San Luis Obispo, CA 93405, USA","formatted_phone_number":"(805) 549-8880","geometry":{"location":{"lat":35.261429,"lng":-120.6763272},"viewport":{"south":35.2600800197085,"west":-120.67767618029148,"north":35.2627779802915,"east":-120.67497821970852}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/generic_business-71.png","id":"9b445d605dc165ef059b78a47a98153f8fe73958","international_phone_number":"+1 805-549-8880","name":"Med Stop Urgent Care","opening_hours":{"open_now":true,"periods":[{"close":{"day":0,"time":"1600","hours":16,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516579200000},"open":{"day":0,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1517155200000}},{"close":{"day":1,"time":"1900","hours":19,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516676400000},"open":{"day":1,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516636800000}},{"close":{"day":2,"time":"1900","hours":19,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516762800000},"open":{"day":2,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516723200000}},{"close":{"day":3,"time":"1900","hours":19,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516849200000},"open":{"day":3,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516809600000}},{"close":{"day":4,"time":"1900","hours":19,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516935600000},"open":{"day":4,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516896000000}},{"close":{"day":5,"time":"1900","hours":19,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1517022000000},"open":{"day":5,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516982400000}},{"close":{"day":6,"time":"1600","hours":16,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1517097600000},"open":{"day":6,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1517068800000}}],"weekday_text":["Monday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Tuesday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Wednesday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Thursday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Friday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM","Saturday: 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM","Sunday: 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM"]},"photos":[{"height":3072,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111557884895470941076/photos\">Paul Malarik Jr</a>"],"width":4608},{"height":4032,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/118307859038542712609/photos\">Tommy Shoemaker</a>"],"width":3024}],"place_id":"ChIJ1T4nJd3w7IARB_xmg0OtIxM","rating":3.2,"reference":"CmRRAAAAneBkTxyFChn-a4vSQUcQY0AjE9BDb3QxMvwxBlDekOPntZtlZjgFNP31DNaGWgH15N_tpqV7YR41mm_OW4Foo81CXT3vHsvmYBt8zJoN9hE2tVyKuzQnJNL--Q-y91aOEhD9tzThMt4hcU-4Qk2Y0_sFGhRBuM_0N7t9bT043cvfZ_reAQ2FXg","reviews":[{"author_name":"Cyndi Park","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115451771647909806551/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xcB8K9RYdlY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACw/4eenzxvbLNQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"They were fast, caring and took great care of me.

I had faith in my Dr. Who was excellent. Dr. Fow.......... I had an absolute horrible experience there! The pre op was excellent!  but post was a NIGHT MEAR !!!! I HAD TO CHECK OUT THE VERY NEXT DAY.  THE FACT  THAT PEOPLE ARE THAT CALLOUS AND IGNORANT IN THE HEALING INDUSTRY.????? They put me in a room w/ the TV blaring! .The room mate needed to have her phone taken away.!! and how many people are aloud in a room? She must of had her whole family there.Bunch of rude hillbillies!   The women next to me had something, They were not sure what it was? I heard that. They would get back to her when they knew. Complications of pneumonia.  The tubes going to her lungs, ? I HEARD ABOUT THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND THE INFECTION ON GOING!!!!!!! Only being a few feet away I heard every thing!!  They admitted it was one of the NOISIEST rooms, being next to the entrance doors.I realize the day nurse that was assigned to me had too many patients. Thats just BAD MANAGEMENT!   The management are too cheep to care and too Callous.  THERE WAS ONE SMALL SPACE HIGH UP ON THE WALL FOR FLOWERS? Hard to see them. THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THE ROOMS TOGETHER.  The grave yard nurse did meet my needs.She was FOCUSED, PRESENT ATTENTIVE, .EXCELENT! I MISSED HER. And I could sleep a bit,but the day shift sounds like a full blown party! Loud laughing, Circus like. My  Roommate was on the phone a lot..So  many people in the room, They could have shut my drape, but no. THE FIRST DAY I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING drinking  WATER, AND ICE FOR MY WOUND. I asked for water 3 times. It took 1 1/2 hrs. to get it!   When your hip gets replaced you do need ice on it. My ice pack was room temperature when I woke. After throwing up all day after surgery.WHERE WAS THE NAUSIA MEDS? I was told breakfast is at 7:00 am. It did not come till 8:30 or 9:00 . I waiting to see if I could keep it down? I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET MY BLOOD SUGAR UP BEFORE P.T. AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SHOWED UP. BREAKFAST WAS SO LATE!!!!!! WHAT IS WRONG W/ THE KITCHEN?????? THEY COME IN W/ THESE BIG SMILES, I JUST WANT PEOPLE THAT ARE FOCUSED, and PRESENT!  HAVE SOME INTEGRITY!!!!AROUND ME, WHEN I'M IN A HEALING CRISIS.  Occupational therapist came shortly after that and wanted to get  me up. I told her I was hungry.  She offered some crackers, Which was like paste in my continuously dry mouth. I could not swallow them. WHO IN THERE RIGHT MIND WOULD OFFER ME DRY CRACKER, WHEN THEY WORK IN THAT FIELD YRS. AND ARE WELL AWARE THE MEDS MAKE PATIENTS MOUTH DRY!    She was A real treat!!!    I tried to get up and broke out in a sweet felt like passing out. I needed to eat more than a bowl of cream of wheat. IT HAD BEEN 2 DAYS SINCE I HAD EATEN. The P.T. came , I told her I was hungry and needed protein.She  got me yogurt  brought me a menu,  THE P.T .ALSO DOUBLED MY ICE PACK. WHICH HAD BEEN NEGLECTED THE DAY BEFORE FOLLOWING SURGERY. I WAS IMPRESSED!   I ASKED TO GET A DIFFERENT NURSE, REALIZING I WAS ON THE BACK BURNER , NOT GETTING MY NEEDS MET. THEY DIDN'T RESPECT MY WISHES. I ordered lunch FROM A FRIENDLY GUY, NOT FOCUSED THOUGH! It sounded good, BBQ chicken. It was like eating rubber. WHO CAN'T COOK CHICKEN???? I forced a few bites down knowing I needed protein. I told them I love potatoes any way there cooked. Please! it's my comfort food. He said he would bring me potato salad. No POTATO showed up .Disrespect for the IRISH! just dry broccoli. I had to check out 2 days earlier than my Dr. ordered. I couldn't take any more abuse!!! That hospital is the farthest thing from healing. All there Art on the walls of the main entrance: regarding compassion and healing is a lie. Be honest your CALLOUS!  ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS MONEY. I REALY FEEL SORRY FOR THE INURED VETERANS.

We go our entire lives without having to share a sleeping space with strangers, until we are unfortunate enough to be ill or injured to the point where we require overnight care in a hospital. Dignity, privacy, rest and comfort are impossible when the only barrier between you and one, or even two strangers and their friends, family and caregivers, is a curtain. This is no way to spend the most difficult times in our lives. Pointing at other hospitals with a similar layout does not fix the problem. I think you people put \"dignity\" in the name, so you wouldn't have to spend the money to put dignity in the patient rooms. \n\nEven the cheapest hotel room is private, secure and quiet, and a hospital stay is anything but inexpensive. I have been hospitalized twice in my life, and was lucky enough to stay in hospitals with single-patient, private rooms both times. \n\nPlease consider adding private rooms to your hospital for the good of your patients and their families.\n\nUpdate: Dad and Mom both got severe upper respiratory infections following Dad's stay in the hospital, first in a room with one man being treated for a URI, and then in a room with two men being treated for URI's.
