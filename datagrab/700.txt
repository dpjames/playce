You've literally got a BIG neon sign in the window that's boasting \"OPEN TIL' MIDNIGHT\"  and last Saturday night, I was there at 11:35 and refused service. \n\nSo this Saturday night at 11:20pm  I just got out of a recording session, hungry as all get-out, I tried calling my order ahead twice.  Both times it went to voicemail.  So I drove over, parked out front and when I came to the counter at 11:35PM the guy looked at me and said they just took the last order for the night.  Really?  C'mon.  I called twice.\n\nI've encountered this a few times now enough to write this.   Now I have all due sympathy to work staff not wanting to get slammed right before closing and I'm always very gracious in those situations.  If a tip option is given, I go 20 to 25%.  I've worked in restaurants, I get it,  but if you don't want to be open until midnight, don't advertise it.   This wingstop is located on one of the busiest corners of a college town that is known to be out late.  It wasn't as though it was a slow night.      \n\nI often play gigs that go from 9pm to 12am and at 11:20, I don't get up on the mic and say \"Sorry guys, I'm going to stop it here because I'm scheduled to 12am and I want to start packing up my equipment so I can get home on time.\"   Do you know how quickly I'd be fired?  I play my set as posted and then when the place closes I break down my gear.  That's the job I'm hired to do and the job the staff at wing stop is hired to do.\n\nIf you want to be open until 11:30, I'm fine with that, but don't refuse customers a good 25minutes before closing.  Seriously, get your fast food chain restaurant out of this town if you're not going to play by the same rules the locals do.

It seems that the owners tried to cut corners where they could, even doing there own maintenance.  There are ugly patch jobs on the bathroom walls where the shower curtain used to be mounted and the town rack is far from level.  There were two of us standing there when we checked in, but we were only given one room key.  The only toiletries provided in the room were bar soap and shampoo.  The breakfast has a waffle maker, but just toast and muffins to accompany it.  Great if you are on a high-carb diet.  The hot tub has been replaced with a concrete slab.  There is a walk in closet, but the only thing in the closet is a mini-fridge with a microwave on top.  The bar to hang clothes is not in the closet, but on the wall right in front of the closet door, partially blocking the doorway.  There are motion sensor light switches in the room, making it impossible to move around without lights coming on when you don't want them to.  The front curtains do not keep light from coming in on all sides when closed, making it impossible to keep the outside lights out when trying to sleep at night.  The bottom sheet on the bed is a flat sheet that is not big enough to wrap around the bottom of the mattress.  You can open the front window and bathroom window to get a cross breeze, which is nice.","time":1516131516},{"author_name":"Gautham B","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117700035691606518657/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8b1icJz8ja4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAQ_A/VE3J3HMZ1UE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Stayed here for a night.

Our trip included a visit to Hearst Castle nearby, which added to the unique memory.","time":1516124552},{"author_name":"Melissa Padilla Wegner","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103224897841473686191/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dZpMcD9Y3sg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA44/BN0iT3M3OXk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"I did not stay at the Madonna Inn but I did use the spa facilities.

Called ahead to make reservations. Had plans to have dessert & drinks there since everyone says the cake is great. We sat down and moments later were asked to move. Apparently you can only sit in the restaurant if you are having an entree. Which no one ever told us when we made the reservation. The servers words were \"you need to have at least one entree.\" So then we thought about getting one just so that we could continue our night and then she changed it to \"you must have a few.\" She said we would have to sit in the dancing/bar area. So we had to move from our table over to the bar area. The place was practically empty and no one was waiting but we still were forced to move. The server said she would have someone take our order but it wasn't until about 30 min later that someone come over and that's only because we got up and asked. When the server did come she was very rude. She dropped the menus and left. She was coughing and sneezing. I wanted to feel\nBad for her for working when she's sick but even when we tried to be nice to her she was still rude. Everyone else had Ice cold drinks and ours looked and tasted like it came right out of the faucet. They were out of every cake we wanted and the one slice we did get was not good at all! We were only given one fork for 7 people so we had to ask for forks and plates. The atmosphere of the people there was nice and friendly for the most part but the employees were not! Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, we started to walk to the front to pay and one of the servers started to run towards us and comment that we were trying to skip out the bill. We got to the counter and 6 workers were there talking about personal things and no one would stop to help us. When they finally decided to talk to us, they said they could not help us there and sent us to the bar to pay. No one and I mean no one was friendly to us. We were the only Mexican people there and sadly it was very evident that we were being treated different then everyone else. To accuse us of skipping out on the bill was just so petty and sad. I would never go back there because it is not a place that seems to be open to people of color. I wish this was something I could report to the authorities.

Not to mention you can reserve your seating through their website or app (which takes you to their mobile website),  so you don't need to worry about getting there an hour early for a good/new movie.","time":1514666196},{"author_name":"kriska parda","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112983796848218568680/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-16eRRFBGcgU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAS7I/g04wRX5mwN4/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I was in town over Thanksgiving weekend and believe it or not, saw 3 movies here in 3 days.

I went to the San Luis Obispo restaurant for the first time and brought my wife there too. She had never had a Round Table pizza before and I wanted her to try it. We went for the lunch special. We both put lots of Parmesan cheese on top of our pizzas and the pizza was pretty good. Just as I had finished, my wife noticed a black  bug that was about a half inch to an inch long inside the Parmesan cheese shaker. The bug was alive and pretty active in the cheese. I took the shaker to the manager and she said it was pretty disgusting. My wife didn't want to finish the last slice of her pizza and I didn't want it either after what I saw.  The manager said it was a \"pincher\" bug and they were all over San Luis. She said they sprayed every month but the area was infested with them. I kept wondering if they lay eggs in the cheese that we liberally  sprinkle out over the pizzas. It could have happened to any restaurant I suppose, but it left a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively that is).","time":1477537074},{"author_name":"Kate Brennan","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104761735240512986941/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HYY2maJdmPU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAOXQ/ALJgC2wDMtY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"It is what it is...Round Table.

Otherwise, the pizza's come out burnt, the line is slow and place is a mess. But for 8.00 you get a 12 inch personalized pizza with as much toppings as you can coax the employees into giving you. It is also a hit or miss weather they have the toppings you want. I went on Sunday and no chopped tomatoes, time before that, out of pesto sauce. The time before that my husbands pizza came out burnt. When he took it back to complain they made a big deal about remaking his pizza and told him he would have to go to the back of the line. However, someone else stepped in and moved him to the make line and remade the pizza. It seems like they have a high staff turn over rate. Every time I've gone in there, there are tons of employees but no faces I recognize from the time before. They are now carrying a new soda, which I love, made with cane sugar. So if you can avoid the crowd, get a your pizza without getting it burned, for 8 bucks it's not to bad to sit out on the patio and get some sunshine.","time":1494916128}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["meal_takeaway","restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=13279441120030889843","utc_offset":-480,"vicinity":"892

There's a location a couple of miles from my office and I'd go pick it up, bring it back and have time to enjoy it on my break. The #8 comes with bacon, but for the last several visits, they've forgotten to include it. So I attempted to adjust my order and add \"extra bacon\" to see if that would help. That only work once and for the last 3 consecutive visits, no bacon and no extra vinegar which I always request. After these failed attempts, I gave them another try and chose a later time like 2pm for lunch pickup. Maybe it's getting forgotten during a rush. So, I went in at 215 for my 2pm pick up and not only was it not ready; it hadn't even been started; and there were no customers in line! So I sat down, checked messages, but upin near completion, of my sandwich, I had to remind them about the bacon & vinegar. This is super diappointing, because I love Jersey Mike's and am happy to pay double if it were just made correctly! I used to spend about $30 or more a week, but now, I don't even consider this location an option for a lunch break. Unless I go in on a weekend when I plenty of time to kill, I won't be returning. I've given this location many, many chances, but to no avail.","time":1497645785},{"author_name":"Justin Fraser","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106041347724748081300/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fxW2mwK0QZY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA9g/i4PdxYij-vI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Best cheese steak on the Central Coast.

It was easy to get an estimate (no week(s) long wait for an estimate appointment like some other companies) and they were flexible with the schedule when closing/move dates changed.   \n\nThe office staff was professional and friendly.   The estimate was done quickly and all of my questions were answered clearly.  \n\nThe crew was friendly, efficient, and polite; they maintained a positive, cheerful attitude while working very hard.  Hallways, floors and doorjambs were covered so that nothing was scratched or damaged.  Furniture, the TV and other Items were wrapped securely and safely.   The entire process went quickly and the crew was responsive regarding furniture placement and set up.   As an added perk, Sandercock provided free wardrobe boxes which made moving the closet as simple as it could possible be.  \n\nI have moved many times, but never felt so positively about the company and crew I worked with.

Never wanting to apologize or make things right with the people who lost their belongings to Rat Damage.\n SLO Self storage has the same problems.\nThe owners used to be nice to their customers and business partners, but now they have this young FAT CHICK running the office and pissing people off.","time":1498183522},{"author_name":"Steven Kolb","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117072663316202178543/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6JKXgCAlVP0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD8/4UnfshcwPWE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"8 months ago","text":"I called and spoke to a very nice woman who said she would hold a 5x7 unit for me until the following Thursday when my daughter could come in and fill out the paperwork.

However, by using Browder (twice now)  I am guaranteed that the job will be done right and on time; plus they have strict requirements and training for their painters.
