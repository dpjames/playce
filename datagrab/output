San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport
Have had some few-hour delays here...But not too bad. Really small, but easy airport to navigate‚Äîyou can see end to end, so there‚Äôs hardly any worry of missing the gate/wrong area. Gets foggy and they reroute flights to SF and LA with little to no compensation for not doing their job..not exactly ‚ÄúSLO‚Äôs‚Äù fault but seriously this place CAN be a pain

Never had a bad time there and live in SLO travel almost once a month. The updates look cool although if it does get busy I could see congestion happening as 3 gates are stuffed into each corner. Yesterday (Christmas eve)  one of the ladies at security was extremely rude and actually mean. She had me so flustered I actually walked away and burst into tears over a minor thing.... It was horrible how she treated me,  talking over me when I tried to ask her a question and being super aggressive. There was no need for it.

New Airport! Fresh Pictures! Love the new security security process and it‚Äôs kinda awesome how we have an ‚Äúopen air waiting‚Äù area! IÔ∏è travel so much IÔ∏è basically live in airports but SLOs new airport has the coolest jet bridge I‚Äôve been in.

Met a flight at 5:49 pm 17th November. Hard to read the keypad on ticket booth, it was not fully lit.  Then proceeded to elevator.  It was out of order, how is a major piece of equipment out of order at a new facility. Unable to walk up stairs so I had to use the ramp, very glad I did not have my wheel user daughter with me.  Is that long ramp ADA compliant? It seemed dangerously steep and too long to me.
Flight Information Board in terminal was tucked away in a corner?  Why is it not in plain view when you enter?
Think I will still use Santa Maria airport.

Terrible experience. Our arrival was scheduled for after 1AM and we had a rental car reserved, expecting to wait it out until the rental counter was open. We were not only informed that we could not wait for our car, but very rudely treated by the staff. Needless to say, having flown 6 hours to get here we were unfamiliar with the area and forced to bide our time in the local Denny's since it was all that we could find still open at that time. When I asked the employee when the airport would re-open, he hesitated. As I pressed for an answer he informed me it would open at 4AM, but that we would not be allowed to wait there. We returned at 4 and quietly waited at the rental counter and, amazingly, had no ill effects on the staff, building, or fellow travelers. He also curtly informed me that the Avis employee waited on ME until midnight. This is offensive in that their scheduled and posted hours are until midnight, so this individual was waiting for their shift to end, not on me. Additionally, our flight arrived after 1AM so I did not miss them out of negligence as he suggested, but because they had left a full hour or more before I set foot in the door. My issues are 1) this has never happened to me or anyone I've known through countless trips involving a multitude of airports and 2) if the airport does indeed close at a certain time (in this case 12:30), so be it, but then do not schedule flights arriving past that time. This was not due to a delay, this was a scheduled arrival. 3) this staff member was curt, rude, and insensitive. No other airport would kick travelers out rather than letting them sit quietly in a chair and wait. Needless to say we will avoid this airport at all cost in the future.

Steynberg Gallery
I love this place for two reasons: 1. They have GREAT teas! You wont find any trashy Stash here. 2. They have GREAT music playing. You'll hear oldies, jazz, and and great world music at decent decibels (thank you for not giving into the club music at all hours trend so many other coffee shops have fallen into). PLUS Steynberg has a bright, open ambiance, great beagles, and rotating artwork! Definitely my favorite place to get work done, get inspired, or get together with friends.

Very relaxing and artistic atmosphere all around. Great teas and coffee, and plenty of treats if you need a small bite to eat.

They seem to not want students studying here with computers, as seen in the lack of outlets, and their tables are a bit small, so it only works as a study spot for one person anyways. If you're looking for a study spot, you might want to go somewhere else. If you want to relax and talk about the arts, this is the perfect place to go.

This gallery and coffee shop is a leading independent place in San Luis. They sponsor art in so many forms and display it and encourage it and are part of the art community. That said let us turn to the coffee. Great coffee and always friendly we stopped there often

Excellent espresso drinks, chai tea and muffins.  Lovely mix of cafe, art gallery and small performing arts venue, with a stage and a bar.

Great coffee, beautiful gallery. A really nice place to go in the mornings.

========================================================
Hands Gallery
Great place to browse and discover new, creative things, especially if you're shopping for gifts or really anything outside the ordinary department store experience. 

Hands Gallery is a must stop when we have out of town guests. The breadth of their art and the quality of the pieces make this a favorite stop. The selection is quite eclectic, and to some degree defies description. If you are looking for an odd set sof salt and pepper shakers, or an incredible engraved dinner table, or hundreds of items in between, there seems to be something for everyone here! Go Often, increase art collection and enjoy life!

Coffee is amazing and I love the newspaper on each table. I would have liked to see a few more smiles from the staff.

Had a delicious oat scone and a hot chocolate,  both were great and the service was wonderful!

Great Chai latte, cold or hot. This place has been here for a long time with a name change or two under its belt. It's a nice reprieve from the kreuzberg, or Starbuck busy body places elsewhere in downtown SLO.

Very GOOD COFFEE! Yummi food choices! And parking isnt too bad either. Girls were very sweet and Good attitude with Custmersüíñ

Delicious espresso drinks! Quick service!

Ascendo Coffee
Instantaneously fell in love. If I would live in this city I would be here all the time. Open space yet you can find some privacy, there's a community space with no laptop allowed with wood chess boards, flowers, and board games/books. No loud up-beat music. This afternoon it was Amelie Poulain soundtrack, it was great and soft. To drink, I had Jasmin Tea with a hint of house-made vanilla syrup and house-made almond milk. It was great. Their Ice Latte is legit. Enjoy your stay there!

Out of all the hip new coffee shops in SLO, this one is my favorite for a simple cup of classically roasted joe... or java... or whatever else they got now. Totally worth the trek. Great revolving artwork that displays the diversity of artistic talent amongst the locals, and the barista‚Äôs don‚Äôt leave... so you know the return customers treat them well.

This place hit the trifecta for me - great ambiance, friendly staff, and really good coffee. Plus, the music added to the relaxed vibe. I also grabbed a couple of pastries, which were really good, as well.

Easily the best coffeeshop in a long time. We got the brown sugar latte with extra espresso shot and almond milk. The drink was one of the best espresso drinks Ive had in a very long time. I was shocked. They have house made almond milk that was mind blowing. I asked for a small sample of it.. It was far superior to any store bought almond milk. You could actually taste real almond, and it had an almond powderyness that was amazing. The shop inside is really nice and modern. It's spacious and open. They have board games to play and chess tables with fancy pieces already setup. They have a no laptop section so people can socialize, which we thought was cool. Overall, I'd definitely stop here again next time in SLO.

Quaint yet trendy. Ascendo coffee embodies everything people need in a quiet coffee shop for conversation and fellowship. The baristas are kind and considerate. Their latte art is second to noneüëåüëåüëå The venue is warm, well-lit and open. And if that isn't enough to convince you this should be your next stop for your SLO-calized coffee experience then I'll even go so far as tell you this... If the joy of life is a cup, Ascendo is where I go for refills

Copper Cafe
The Madonna is a MUST see location. If you can't afford to stay there or dine in their main restaurant, I recommended giving yourself a nice self guided tour of the place and eat at their coffee shop!

The staff is wonderful and welcoming. Exploring the venue is encouraged! Look at the bright pink main restaurant, bars, dance floor, fireplace, gift shop and don't forget the basement restrooms (a must, trust me)!!!

The coffee shop is like diner food. The food is average and it's pricey for what it is for sure... but it's worth it to sit down and enjoy the scenery. There is a book about the place they sell for $50 but you can bring the restaurant's copy to your table and check it out while you dine. It's super cool. The food is a 3, but the grounds are a 5+, which is why only 4 stars since this review is supposed to just be for the restaurant. 

A MUST see!!!


My husband and I stopped here for a quick bite in between lunch and dinner. We both ordered salads, I ordered a half veggie sandwich. It took over an hour to get our food. And once we did finally get our orders, the bottom slice of my bread was so soggy it fell apart when I picked it up. The server was very nice when I asked her for a new piece of bread. Then to top it off, there was a hard stem from an avocado in the sandwich that I could have cracked a tooth on if I had bitten it. Luckily I didn't, and I just felt it in my mouth.  The service has been consistently slow every time we have come for dinner in the past year as well. I think we are done with madonna. The novelty isn't worth the poor service from the kitchen. 

If you're coming here for the food, the best thing is the cake. The lattes and hot cocoas both come from a machine and taste very watered down. The vanilla latte tasted like water with milk in it. The waitress said all danishs were special order. (Not sure what that means) so we were unable to order any. If you want to eat in the cafe it seems the only good food is the cake, nothing else is worth the cost (very expensive for the quality). I would only reccomend visiting to see the building itself not for the food.

Great food, the waitress was very helpful and the hostess (the younger ( was great

Love the inn and go at least 4 times a month. Service needs to be improved as lately it's been less friendly and accommodating (that's why I took a star off my rating).

My order always comes out right and they have pretty tasty dessert treats. Gets really busy at times with a moderate wait but perfection takes time.. totally worth it!

Everything was great. Had a latte and a panini, so I can say the food is as good as the coffee.

Good coffee, but food items are a bit pricey

Everything was great. Great coffee, Great pastries and great and cheerful people at the shop.

The food & beverage service/quality is on par with all the Blackhorse Coffee Shops in SLO. However, there are only 5 spaces for parking so if your not coming in foot you'll have to park and walk over. This location has covered outdoor seating which I really love on a rare rainy SLO day.

Art Central
The staff here is super knowledgeable and very friendly. They will take the time to answer all of your questions and make sure you get exactly what you need.

They sold me a $3 tube of paint for $20. Do not shop here

Nice little art store! Staff are friendly and extra helpful:) 

I do watercolor and they have a good selection of supplies.

Very helpful. Although they don't have water soluble oil paints they we're willing to order for me without paying shipping. Love the art membership savings. Shop local!

House of Bread
Go early for best selection. Don't miss the day old rack for bargains. Some samples are fresh from the oven and still warm.

Ironically, the bread itself isn't really the star of the show here. It's not bad, but it's all a bit samey. The pastries, sandwiches, and breakfast baguettes are the real reasons to come in. The Baguettes sell out pretty early in the morning most mornings, but the pastries are there all morning and they're fantastic. For lunch, the club on Garden Herb bread is primo.

The quality is just fantastic. We have been getting bread here for years and it is so much better than grocery store bread. Our favorite is the raspberry swirl bread (makes great toast). We also love the cinnamon swirl bread for french toast, the garden herb for sandwiches, the oatmeal applesauce for peanut butter sandwiches, the jalapeno jack for grilled chicken sandwiches. The croissants are the best around and the cranberry bran muffins are tasty and unique. They offer samples too! I love trying new stuff while I pick up our regulars. 

This is a great neighborhood bakery ! We were on vacation from Palm Springs and I was craving some baked goods. I walked in and was quickly offered a sample of fresh sourdough bread. The lady behind the counter sliced off a huge , thick piece of bread and offered me some butter ! It was delicious ! I'm hooked ! We purchased a couple of loaves and we were on our way.

Good pastries and breads. Fresh and samples

A consistently interesting place to see new art in SLO. Probably the only place you will see contemporary work from the big cities. Curated expertly by someone who actually knows what's going on in the art world, I always make a point to stop here every month.

Can always find the beautiful and the unusual! Fun place to shop!

Such a beautiful space, great variety of artwork and plants: cactus, succulents, and air plants. I bought a gorgeous cactus, but came home to find it had terrible root rot. Although the gal I spoke to was very sweet on the phone and offered to switch it for another in store, I live out of town and was supremely bummed as it was kinda expensive :/

Matt Clark Tile & Stone
After a flood in our home which required the removal of the existing fireplace, office flooring and baseboard, I contacted Matt Clark Tile for help designing the new fireplace and ultimately installing the beautiful custom tile I selected from their showroom.  Working with Matt Clark was a smooth and professional process.  The installation of the tile was an amazing process to watch.  The work area was well protected and left clean after each day of work.  The personal attention from Matt Clark, his staff and tile installers is something you will not get from the big box stores.  If you have a tile project, take the time to visit Matt Clark Tile.

Great selection and friendly service. They really helped me with my bathroom tile for two home locations. Katie was really professional and easy to work with. I can't wait for my next renovation project so I can work with them again!

Huge collection with top quality products, friendly and helpful staff. The product specialist Anna is absolutely fabulous! Would  definitely recommend stopping by.

Went into the store because, strangely enough, Matt Clark is also my name. Glad I did. Incredible selection of tile. Matt did a great job on the installation. Very helpful staff to work with.

Beautiful tile....tile from Spain, England and hand made in America! It‚Äôs a tile candy store! We had a vision for our bathrooms and they made it happen with helpful suggestions! Can‚Äôt wait to do the kitchen with them..!!!!

SLO Donut Co.
Well worth visiting!  Super fresh donuts as it's popular with the locals and college students. Only a little pricer than average donut shops,  but well worth it with all the custom varieties. Board games and lots of seating available. Kept me and my kids entertained for a one hour total visit.

Great vibe. Very chill. Fun donut choices. 
Only reason not a 5star is they were out of couple donuts I liked. However, the new one I tried was good too

This is strictly for the GF/Vegan option! 

I can only speak for the gluten-free vegan donut, but it tasted like chemicals and bad, with an awful texture. 

I appreciate that they HAVE GF donuts (and vegan ones too!) hence the second star... but, I pretty much spat my first bite out and didn't finish it. 

That said, they have an amazing collection and the space was cool.

Used to be a loyal sunshine fan but have seen the light, it's got a college atmosphere if you are into but if not the doughnut is worth it anyway.

Most definitely the best donut shop! I got their Strawberry üç∞ cake donut and hot apple cider. Super good!

Fastframe
Hey, I had work done here....years ago, before there was a Google or Yelp and so did not have the opportunity to post a review...so, I am just now catching up.  I want to say that the help in selecting the right frame and border, the end result and especially the service was excellent...if you need a frame, I wouldn't go anywhere else!

Friendly service and nice frames

Joe and Susie are the best! They have such an artist's touch with their framing. Top notch quality, attention to detail, mat work, and they also have the coolest frames to choose from. I don't even try to pick out what will go best with the piece of art because they know their stuff so well--I just tell them do what you think is best and every single time they deliver my art my mind is blown. I would never hire anyone else for framing!

More expensive than most coffee joints, but it makes up for it with a large selection of pastries and sandwiches, ample parking, and a lack of crowds which plagues many of the other SLO coffee shops (especially during midterms and finals weeks).

Friendly staff, plenty of seating. Delish

Strangely bright for a coffee shop, definitely feels like you're in a cheap strip mall. High rating for staff and drink/food quality.

The Establishment itself is nice and clean with a good atmosphere but I find what they serve to be very underwhelming especially for the price point

Nice coffee place.  I'll be back.

I'm a student, and I work full time. I had a W2, and some accounts I needed to file. I was never actually quoted how much it would cost, but I let the lady finish my taxes regardless after seeing all the "free student" commercials; I didn't think it would be too expensive. I was charged $220, and it took an extra 2 weeks due to my tax agent not understanding how to deal with my forms fully. On a positive note, the agent was friendly, communication was easy, and it's a professional business.

Long long long wait times. Even with an appointment, had to wait 30 minutes sitting in the waiting area.

This place is very expensive.  With the amount of time it takes to prepare your taxes for you they are easily making a killing.  If you don't have time or don't know how to do your taxes this place is probably your best option.

My advice..learn how to do them yourself.

Cowboy Cookie & Ice Cream
Loved the cookie cup! I got the peanut butter one, and it was awesome!!

Their holiday flavors are AMAZING! Chocolate preppermint is my favorite!!!

Cookies are a tad hard to eat as a sandwich with softer ice cream between them. Maybe underbaking the cookies, that's how I like them anyway, might help a little? Obviously I don't know but the ice cream went everywhere when you tried to take a bite. Great flavors though!

Website says open to 9:00pm... employee closed up at 8:20 and said he was closed for the night?!?! What? Go to a real ice cream shop like Doc Burnsteins

Pumpkin Ice cream and snicker doodle cookie cups are delicious!!!

Einstein Bros. Bagels
The only place within hundreds of miles that makes & sells Bagels
7 days a week & is open till about 9 pm.  While it is a bit hard to get to if you are not a Cal Poly student/ staff & have a parking pass, it is the
free parking feature on most weekends that benefit all.

The only other Bagel places in any nearby town that make Bagels close
at about 3 pm.

This Bagel place does sell a bakers dozen with two small tub of cream cheese for about $18.  They have the ever popular "Everything" as well as, a fair assortment of others. 

They also do make the NY style of Bagels & lox.
This location is right in the middle of the Cal Poly Village for students.

If you want to wait 30 minutes for a good bagel then come to Einstein's!

Sufficiently fast service and good sandwiches.  Prices are good but not an amazing value.  

Tasty food. Probably the best place on campus. Slightly expensive though.

Couldn't go in because of no public parking. Great location for the cal poly students staying in the nearby dorms. Not really designed for the general public access

Splash Caf√©
awesome lobster roll and chowder! toasted bun was just right and kept the overflowing lobster on its path into my mouth. the freshness of the celery provided a nice flavor companion. the chowder was deliciously creamy and had perfect bite sized chunks of clam and potatoes. would go again.

We have eaten here twice while in SLO & it was very good both times. And the most important thing, it has a parking lot might not be an empty spot, but, your chances are better than finding a spot on the street.

The new one downtown was awful Blan no flavor hardly any clams in the chowder. So being unsatisfied I went to the one on Monterey Street the old one. And it was like night and day and give the splash on Monterey five stars. But they should shut down the new one that‚Äôs in the courtyard

Wonderful food and service. Staff is always in a good mood

This place was delicious. Fresh everything. My husband got the half pastrami sandwich on pesto focaccia bread that was simply divine with a bowl of amazing clam chowder. Literally the best I've EVER tasted. I got a grilled salmon sandwich with a house made caper sauce.

 The customer service was out of this world. It's a must stop by when in town or pass through. Or if you lucky enough to live near by.

They also have amazing looking desserts. We were too full to try but I have no doubt it's tasty. One thing to consider is, our orders did not some with any fries or sides in case your wondering.

========================================================
Laguna Grill
Great place with friendly and fast service. Had the tri tip sandwich, family had hot dog and chicken. Tenders. Food was great. Would recommend this place to friends

I had the cheese steak and onion rings. Our food came out fast. The steak was tough and obviously old, and rewarmed. The onion rings were hot on the outside, cold and we'll cooked inside, and very greasy. Like they were prepared in advance.

Great for watching sports, but the food is small and tasteless. My daughter got the child's menu shrimp and chips and was shocked to only see 3 shrimp. We came home and she ate a second lunch.
My sandwich (BALT) was bland, disappointing.
The onion rings were good!

We went their with kids, and loved that there was extra seating away from the louder main area. Unfortunately the 1 year old was unable to use the high chair due to broken straps. And only got 4 jalape√±o poppers in the appetizer. Food was decent, pricey for what it was however and my burger didn't come with any fixings, which was unexpected.

fantastic food for the price, clean atmosphere, and friendly staff. I love the mushroom, cheese and avacado burger...DELICIOUS!

Wells Fargo Bank
While I am not a Wells Fargo member, I did go in as a customer to exchange foreign currency last week.  My take away from the experience was not my best banking experience.  It started with the realization that I would be paying an additional fee - on top of the exchange charge - just to do the transaction - I was told that with a saccharine smile and air of superiority from the teller.  They are the only game in town and take advantage of that position.  Obviously it is a cash transaction, but once the sums were sorted I needed to leave the counter, go to an ATM (within the building) go back to the counter... plus they required my SSN, and more information than I gave when making a new car purchase which cost 200X the sum I was trying to get in pounds sterling.  At the end of the day, I left with what I had gone in to get, but the entire experience felt hollow.

Not prepared, and Angelica just seems incapable of apologizing in any way. I was there Friday to set up a new account and I had a slightly unusual need for a notary. Manager Chris and notary Angelica said they would be ready for me Tuesday. When I arrived Tuesday, Angelica had not prepared, wouldn't even begin to apologize, said she couldn't fill out a form she had looked at the previous Friday and said was OK then. She really made my experience stressful as it was related to a court appearance by phone. She had to call notary tech support and kept telling them that what I was asking for was so out of the ordinary. I had given her my phone number back on Friday and said to call if there were any problems, but she dropped the card and I watched Raj throw it away. Also when Raj opened my account she setups a ATM card and then spent a long time trying to give me a temporary card. She was supposed to set up a debit card, as I repeatedly asked about their policy of waiving the fee if I make ten debit purchases per month. Sounds like WF is up to their old fee generating tricks. Avoid Angelica and Raj at this branch.

A bank is a bank, is a bank, right? Well on the local level they stand apart. Staff and tellers are quite pleasant and try to make things as simple as possible. However the bank itself is greedy and foolhardy in it's investment choices so I'd only recommend this branch to withdraw money. Save money & your community - deposit at a local credit union!

They always seem to have a greeter who makes it a pleasant experience. The tellers are nice.  It is either this or the one in Grover Beach, which is also nice....but boasts larger boxes.

Typical Wells Fargo. Pretty good location.

Luna Red
I'm a little meh on this place. Food is alright, definitely small portions though. Dessert is pretty bad, whatever we got, some cookie ice cream thing. Service is good though, and it's snazzy and clean. We were a table of 12 though and asked to split the check 3 ways and the server looked a little angry. If you're looking to class it up, it's a nice place, but if you're looking to eat well and be full, you're probably better off down the road.

Our favorite place to go in SLO. Staff is always friendly and the tapas (especially the bacon-wrapped dates and the bocadillos) and specialty cocktails and pitchers of drinks are AMAZING! We will always return for more.

Luna Red is a great place to have diner! The atmosphere is really pleasant (either in the patio or inside) and the food is really good. Hoummous is delightful and tacos are pretty good too.
Definitely a place to stop by when staying in San Luis!

Popular, trendy place overlooking the San Luis creek and the mission.  Amazing tapas sized sharable dishes for lunch and dinner. Great breakfasts, too.

Definitely a great Tapas and drink venue in beautiful downtown San Luis Obispo...go between 3p and 6p for the Tapas specials and drinks, sit on the patio.  Don't miss the olive bread with rosemary garlic chili aioli.

CoastHills Credit Union
My experience at coast hills has been consistently wonderful for closing in on a decade. Their employees have shown me respect and kindness from day 1. This is truly an earned 5 star rating.

I hate to give bad reviews but using Coast Hills phone service is a nightmare. The people will not assist you when you have a problem, they will not pass you to a supervisor when you ask and most importantly their is no way to contact the individual branch locations. 
I've been with Coast Hills for over 10 years and never had a problem. This year I've encountered two large problems and been dissatisfied with the banks willingness to address the problem or correct their error in a timely fashion.

I just tried to open an account and was told to go elsewhere. I called first to confirm that no appointments were possible, but when I arrived the 2 employees told me to make an appointment and come back because they were busy helping 1 person. When I tried to make an appointment for another day during midday, I was told that appointments are only possible before 10:30 or after 3:30. So they told me to go to a different city to open the account. What a joke. I've used credit unions my entire life and I am shocked how unhelpful these employees were.

Credit Unions are the way to go! You have the ability to protect your money - every dollar deposited buys a vote in how it's to be used used. And knowing your money is being used locally, to benefit our small businesses, instead of lining the pockets of billionaires hundreds of miles away is a great feeling, isn't it?

Dealing with Coast Hills is such a burden. I could have paid my car out right but my parents convinced to get a car loan to build my credit and it has been the worst thing for my credit. When I'd go in and make my payments I would make my whole payment but they werent telling me that half of my payment was going to a fee so now I have 4 months of incomplete payments on my credit. Also for a few months straight I'd come in to make a payment and they would keep telling me my address was incorrect so when I finally asked to speak to the manager she wasn't very friendly or apologetic about the fact that i was unhappy that I had to keep doing the same thing multiple times and that it made my visit longer. Also they won't help me at the desk they make me use the pods. I once waited 10 minutes because I had the time and there was no line initially and finally when I was able to be helped they turned me away and told me that I am taking time away from their business accounts and card holders and it would make them wait longer so then I had to wait another 5 minutes at the pods. A few times I've had a few nice encounters with employees at the SLO location but now I will be going to the Paso location because they are beyond friendly and they don't have pods so I can actually talk face to face with a person which I like and is the whole reason I pay in person to begin with.

Emily‚Äôs Cinnamon Rolls
Honestly, I've never had a worse cinnamon roll. My banana-Nutella roll was small, overpriced, covered in a poorly-made frosting with altogether too much butter, bereft of bananas, and served slowly and clumsily.  That sounds harsh, but it's well-deserved.

Tried it twice and was not impressed. Service is amazing but cinnamon rolls were very dry. Good amount of frosting and cinnamon but the bread part of the roll was below average.

amazing cinnamon rolls, but weird times that they're open that change occasionally and once I went and they were out of cinnamon rolls...

I believe they changed owners. Ive gone twice and they've been closed with a sign says equipment failure, second time I called they said open. I get there it was closed with sign says" cinnamon rolls have not been delivered system failure" the only thing failing is the business!! Bye never again!!

Did they change ownership recently? I just bought some today and they are larger and drier than they used to be. They just werent very soft and moist.

House of Bagels Central Coast
Might be the only decent bagel in San Luis Obispo. While the staff turns over about as often as you would expect a college town bagel shop to, it is a testament to their hiring practices that they always seem to have friendly young people ready to politely make you a bagel. I have been eating bagels here with varying regularity since 2004 and have not been disappointed yet.

Love the pretzel rolls here, super good with a glass of yerba mate. The staff is very nice and personable even when they are swamped. I'd try to avoid Friday mornings as it seems to be crazy busy.

Lots of different bagels and fun selection of cream cheeses. Usually quick turnaround but can get very busy, especially in the morning

You f****** people got the place where I was at Taco King and the food was great how's the back Ally and s***

Place has great food and a super friendly staff. I would highly recommend trying there top hat on a whole wheat everything bagel. Or for lunch California panini.

Founders Community Bank
Do all of our business banking with them and have been happy for over 15 years.

Copy of a letter I sent to the bank - I never got a response.

I stopped in the village of Morro Bay on my way back to San Francisco from a business trip in Santa Barbara. I thought I would visit your little town, having not done so in several years, but wanted to have some extra cash with me for any small purchases I might make. Your bank was the first I happened upon so I stopped to use your ATM. 

Transaction was normal... insert card, select amount, agree to pay the $3.00 fee - higher than average, but expected. The ATM gave me my $40.00, printed a receipt then shut down without returning my card. 

Needless to say, I was a little upset considering I was hundreds of miles from home and a machine had just eaten the only card I carry. I went into the bank and stated that the ATM had shut down without returning my card. The young woman at one of the desks seemed uninterested, in fact amused at my concern. She told me to wait - for what, I don't know as there were no customers in the bank. When she had completed whatever task she was attending, she retrieved my card and instead of apologizing for causing me any distress, inconvenience or harm she told me that it was company policy to confiscate debit cards not issued by Founders that are used in the ATM and destroy them. WHAT? She went on to inform me that the ATM machine is only for bank customers and couldn't understand why it had given me my 40 bucks and charged me 3 dollars. But it was company policy to shred my card. She refused to give me back my credit card and continued to threaten me with shredding it. Needless to say, I was now very angry.

WHY, why was I being treated like a criminal for using a banks ATM, paying its service fee - there was no sign on the machine telling me not to use it? After I raised holy hell, she called someone and got permission to bypass policy as long as I could prove who I was. I provided ID, got my card, signed some form and left... again, with no apology for what was now not just an inconvenience, but for being treated like I had done something wrong - like I was insignificant, I was nothing. She smirked as she returned my card, apparently enjoying my distress. She seemed to find the incident amusing from the beginning, so much so that at one point I even asked her what she found so funny about the situation and my concerns.

I could not believe any of this was happening and all because I was simply using the ATM machine at Founders Bank. You're a publicly traded institution and this is how you treat people, these are your policies?

May I suggest you post a very large sign over your ATM machine that unless you are a customer of that bank you should not use your credit card or debit card for it will be confiscated, shredded and you will be treated like crap by employees of the bank.

I'm not a Founders customer; I parked in the Founders parking lot on South Higuera Street to go to Autozone, not knowing that the parking lot was reserved for Founders Community Bank. An employee of the bank approached me very aggressively and rudely, yelling "Don't you see the sign! This car has to be moved. I'm tired of people parking in my lot." I just hadn't seen the sign - for anyone else, I would have been happy to move my car. But his rude and frankly offensive approach made my blood boil. Like I said, I'm not a Founders customer. But I never will be, thanks to this balding man in his 50's or 60's. And he drives a red sedan.

Tahoe Joe's
I walked in for lunch. Stood by the front to be seated, looked around, made eye contact with 3 servers, yet no one ever came by to seat me. I finally grabbed a menu and seated myself. I sat there waited, made eye contact with several employees, waited, waited, waited. There was only one other table seated, but about 8 employees visible on the floor. I waited, waited and waited. A server finally came by and I said Hi as if she might take my order. She said Hi and kept walking by, so I thought well eventually someone is going to come take my order. I waited and waited, eventually I just got up and walked out.

Outstanding restaurant 
Everything was delicious from the bread to the salad , steak , potatoes green beans 

Wonderful service by Lisa Jay
Will be back

I have such great memories of this place. Always received friendly service and great food!

The service was the Horrible. And for the last 2 hours i have been plucking. Will NEVER go back..... very disappointed.

Service was slow. Food was definitely overpriced. I suspect that some of the stuff is frozen/made off-site. Small soda costs 3.29. This place reminds me of a restaurant that would be on a Gordon Ramsay show.

========================================================
Panera Bread
I decided to check this place out a few days ago because I wanted to try their sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on a ciabatta roll. I arrived around 11:30am. expecting to order this item, but was unfortunately helped by an employee named Morgan was very rude and shrill, and frankly shouldn't be working in customer service. I didn't know that breakfast service ended at 10:30am. It was pointed out to me by Morgan, where the notice is at the bottom of the menu in small letters. I said, "Having that notice at the bottom is very misleading to customers and it's bad customer service." Morgan said, "No, it's not. We're not an all-day breakfast place." Really, she should have shown some empathy instead, offering a solution to my breakfast dilemma by saying, "I'm sorry, we stop serving breakfast at 10:30am, but here are some other choices for you." I became frustrated with her snippy attitude and flabbergasted I would be treated this way, but I was pretty hungry, so I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and an orange juice. She asked if I wanted my receipt, and I said, "No," and then she VIOLENTLY grabbed the receipt from my hand and threw it away, then just stormed off and presumably complained about my behavior to her other coworkers. If I hadn't paid for my food, I would have asked to speak to her manager right then and there. NOBODY deserves to be treated this way, Morgan. I've been in customer service for over 25 years, and you ALWAYS treat your customers with RESPECT, even if you don't agree with them. I will contact Panera corporate about this incident tomorrow (12/19).

I go here on occasion for my work lunches and I am typically in a hurry so I order to go. I typically get a grilled cheese and a Caeser salad. The last couple times I have gone there and asked for the dressing to be tossed on the salad, NOT on the side,  and I have been given a salad with a side of dressing. I clearly do not have time to do it myself, so 3 of the times i brought it back to have them fix it. This final time though I did not, because I was so fed up with how incompetent the staff is that they cannot read a simple direction. TOSS THE SALAD. not only was the salad not tossed but they gave me like half a cup of dressing, I had to use my own at home to make it " a salad" not worth the 6 dollars AT ALL. I would not care as much if I were not rushing but I had stuff to do places to go and didn't have time, but I was in a hurry, and just left the place mad.

Long story of it, don't get specific, they just DON'T GET IT.

Its okay place. Doesn‚Äôt have sweet tea. But all different flavors of it. Not so cool place

It's a chain.so with that out of the way.. most of the "ade" drinks/ teas were empty and appeared to have been for some time.  Simple addition of olives to the order was forgotten. When asked for the forgotten olives, a whopping heaping pike of 4 old olives were provided. Appears to be run and managed by 4 high schoolers, floor unswept and a few tables with crumbs still them.. but as stated it's a chain..what do you expect.. as for the food.. not good not bad

Nothing special, service wasn‚Äôt great, forgot part of my order, and it was slow. 
Has potential definitely lots of room for improvement!

Bliss Cafe
This is a great spot! I was thrilled to find a small place dedicated to vegan eats! I ordered the all day breakfast (burrito version) and wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The burrito was huge and I wasn‚Äôt able to finish it. I also grabbed a chocolate donut on the way out and enjoyed it on the way back home. If I am in the area, I‚Äôll be sure to stop by again.

Bliss Cafe was amazing.  We stopped on our way to Santa Barbara, and we liked it so much we stopped on our way back home.  The highlight was the included salad, which most customers seem to not take advantage of.  I had the Pineapple Teriyaki  the first time, and the Ginger Broccoli the second time.  Both were great, though the second was more unique.  We're thinking of our next vacation in Santa Barbara just to go back!  I'm going to try to get recipes from the owner.

Great place for vegans (I'm not so don't want to give them a poor rating, but my brother in law and his wife loved the place and they are vegan. They said they recommend)

Came from Orange County to SLO for the first time. Found Bliss cafe and decided to try it for breakfast. The cashier and waiter are very friendly and polite. I decided to try the all day breakfast burrito and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! The rest of my party were 5 and they loved the food also. Definately coming back to Bliss without a doubt.

The avocado lemon love salad was so good I forgot to take a photo. I‚Äôm in love.

SLO Brew
Went in on a Sunday around 10:30 and ordered from their brunch menu. The restaurant wasn't too full so staffing was likely minmal. Food took a little while but nothing outlandish. We never got any coffee refills while eating or waiting. We ordered the Red Flannel Hash and it was pretty tasty. Everything was cooked nicely and was presented in a nice cast iron skillet. The unfortunate thing is the skillet was less than half full. The poached eggs were nicely done but the amount of hash that we got was to be honest a bit disappointing. I would try eating there again but for 15 dollars for a hash that was roughly a cup you'll end up feeling a bit short changed.

Killer happy hour deal, peaceful outdoor spot to drink in the back. Could have had more dogs to pump up the vibes. Will be back for mystery concert, posters in the front unclear on when they are but will show up anyhow!

WILL be returning here for sure! Everything on the menu looked amazing, but I couldn't resist the grilled cheese special, OMG! Goat cheese, mozzarella, fig jam, arugula, with a side salad, ridiculously decadent. Sat out back creekside, highly recommend.... listening to the awesome 80s music jamming, seriously a great way to end the weekend. Easy bike ride from where I'm staying and to catch the train home, right in center of town. Sorry, final note... server Daniel was great. Better service than other local places rated highly, IMO.

Customer service is great, however food is ok. The brews are good

Great place to check out the local vibes and have a cold beer. Service was good and reasonably priced.

Rabobank
I sadly regret I ever opened an account with this bank.  They seem to be the most ignorant when I ask questions, they're grossly unavailable either by email, or phone and even when I do a walk in to expedite transactions I have to wait... always put on hold or waiting for someone to call, text or answer my emails.  
Even when I go to the bank, I STILL have to make an appointments to come back.  The person that opened my account in the first place is either not there, and another time, was too busy to help me deposit over $200,000.00 into an IRA account.  If I owned this bank I would fire personnel, and only hire people who are trained, experienced and care about customer service.

Couch Potato
We needed a new couch.  We liked the Ashley Metcalf power recliner sofa we found in the Morro Bay store. We compared couch potato price to other local stores and internet stores and found it a bit higher.
We thought about it for a week or two and then went back to the store and asked if they would price match the the price in the other local store. We gave them a print out showing the other stores price.   Bill Smith, the store manager, was able to match the price saving us about $500.
We bought and paid for the couch and they said delivery would be approximately 2 to 4 weeks.  (Couch potato offers free delivery and setup).  We were surprised when Couch Potato called after a week and a half saying it was in.  

The delivery men brought the couch in and put it in position and assembled the backs to the couch base.

They plugged it in and It works perfectly.

One thing... Be sure you ask for the assembly and troubleshooting paperwork.... Since they did not offer to give the paperwork to us.  

Since the couch is in the middle of the room we did not want cords leading to the couch. We bought the Lismoss mc-160 battery pack on Amazon.  Now we have no cords.... We just need to charge the battery every couple weeks.  I will need to buy a second battery or a Y cable since each recliner end is powered separately with its own power supply.

Fantastic store! Great selection of furniture! Jasmine was super helpful! We love the couch we bought!

The furniture is quite expensive.  The comic sans font on their logo doesn't convey the quality of products sold.

I have had great experiences purchasing furniture over the years from couch potato in San Luis Obispo. The owner stands by his product, gives great deals, and always has a wonderful selection to choose from. I even bought a dining table from him and one of my kids destroyed a chair and he offered to replace it even though it wasn't his fault. You can't beat that. I will continue shopping at this store for furniture as long as I live in this county. I highly recommend this store to anyone.

Great furniture and wonderful design. Extremely elegant. Staff is very friendly and not to pushy

Just Looking Gallery
Incredibly friendly staff. Totally welcoming if you just want to browse, but also have tons of impressive artwork with great character.

I like this place. It's a small gallery and the people there are friendly and helpful. As non-buyer I found it was a pleasant experience.

I get a hat for juggling an a dollar.

Great, small gallery with fantastic, friendly staff and some really unique pieces

This gallery is wonderful.  I couldn't believe the art they have.  A lot is very art deco which I like.  Heard the story of Steve Thomas who was commissioned the The National Parks to recreate art deco posters of all the National Parks.  The owner of Just Looking saw these and decided he not only wanted to carry prints of these, he wanted to commission Steve Thomas to create posters of California beginning with San Luis Obispo and the rest of San Luis Obispo County.  These are very diverse, and in all different sizes.  Now you can buy (as far as I know only here!) any of these, plus any of the national park posters, and others like Santa Fe, and sites in Florida.

Novo Restaurant & Lounge
Love to visit Novo for Lunch or Dinner whenever I am in SLO. Great fusion menu with thoughtfully prepared dishes and selected ingredients. Great selection of wines including local and import plus extensive cocktail and liquor  menu to choose from. Novo boasts fantastic service and the patio is incredible both during the day and at night...if possible get a table with a creekside view! Great for a date or to enjoy a meal with a group of friends. Parking is available on the street, reservations recommended.

Very cute ambiance creekside. Came here with a party of 8. Everyone enjoyed their food! I quite liked my savory crepe. Total bill came out to $163. The only complaint I have is that our food took a very long time to come out...

A Californian fusion restaurant as it offers quite a few Asian dishes.  If course, we skipped those, with the exception of the shrimp roll which I thought was good, but the skin was kind of dried up (probably made ahead).  The scallops were wonderfully delicious, cooked just right, great sauce.  The racks of lamb were pretty good, a bit overcooked.  Of course, the patio seating area was a great place to enjoy these delicious dishes!

Great and different food in nice stream side outdoor dining.

Food was below average. They tried to make up for it with very large portions. Service was good

Pacific Premier Bank
I had to make a phone call today (2.22.17) I called this branch because it's primarily the one we use. However, last week my husband and I stopped by and used another branch (because it was "on our way" basically it was out of convenience) to set up the all necessities  of us being out of the country. We wanted to inform the bank that we would be using our debit cards, out of the country; for the unforeseeable future. We had it set up with different times, my husband was going 1 week before me. He left two days ago and finally arrived 2.21.17.  We gave her the appropriate dates for each of us. The lady behind the teller desk  took all the pertinent information and informed us that we were all taken care of. There is a time difference of about 10 hours between here and there. Today was the first day my husband was there, so I woke up to a text from my husband telling me he is having difficulties and that he's receiving fraud alerts from the bank. Obviously, I called the bank that we primarily use and informed a wonderful, kind, helpful woman by the name of Kristen. After explaining the entire story she was able to rectify the situation in a matter of minutes. I can not ever begin to explain the amount of help she was to us. And I was ever so humbled by her saying, "I'm just doing my job."  Really, because the other teller was supposed to be just doing her job. Which was by far so much more inferior to that of Kristen. She went above and beyond in my opinion, she made sure I had the banks phone number, the direct line, the back line, her email address, and her managers email address. I have all the information that I could possibly need to be able to get in contact with someone there, should any additional problems occur. Now that Kristen is on the team/case I have NO fears that anything other than a great time will be had by my husband and I due to the fact that we will no longer have to worry about issues we thought we had already addressed.They HAVE NOW BEEN DEALT WITH THANKS A MILLION TO KRISTEN !!!!!
Stay tuned because more on Kristen will be discussed. I will also be contacting her manager. 

WAY TO GO KRISTEN!!!!

Great selection of all smoking needs and other stuff you didn‚Äôt know you needed but totally do. Tons of art (glass and not!!) local and not, too. Love the staff and the owner! Basically will help you with whatever you need/any questions really. Have special ordered me stuff before! Been coming here for almost 10 years now, but this is their newly moved location. A lot smaller than the old one, but still almost as great of selection. WAYYY better than the other shops in slo.

Great selection of art glass which I focused on but it looked like a selection of vapes

Good local folk with access to both local and big name stuff. You go here because you want to go to a legit smoke shop, not a bodega trying to upsell you.

Great products Great prices you can't go wrong here.

Great and friendly place to get glass

Rabobank
I sadly regret I ever opened an account with this bank.  They seem to be the most ignorant when I ask questions, they're grossly unavailable either by email, or phone and even when I do a walk in to expedite transactions I have to wait... always put on hold or waiting for someone to call, text or answer my emails.  
Even when I go to the bank, I STILL have to make an appointments to come back.  The person that opened my account in the first place is either not there, and another time, was too busy to help me deposit over $200,000.00 into an IRA account.  If I owned this bank I would fire personnel, and only hire people who are trained, experienced and care about customer service.

They have no concept of wait times.  They talk about everything with the friend they have at their window.

Not recommended.  I got  cash from the ATM.  I paid fees  to get that cash. I go inside with my ATM receipts to exchange the $20s for $100s.  The teller seems willing and nice enough and even counts out all the cash. She wants to confirm with some supervisor.  She then comes back and says since I don't have an account they can't do it.  Makes some comment about the gov has rules about cash transaction and they need a record of who people are for this type of transaction.  Ridiculous and just the worst customer service.   Avoid this bank.  Afterward  I went to 3 other banks (US Bank, Heritage Oaks, Union) they all exchanged cash for me and I didn't even get the cash at their banks!   I need a bank in SLO and even mentioned it to them at Robo, I'll be choosing one of the others. Your ATM could give out $100s, but it gives out $20s.  There is a RECORD with my name on it.   You're just exchanging that money!

I have numerous complaints about this bank. Firstly, it takes literally days for your online money tranfers to go through. If I transfer $50 from my checking to my savings and then forget about it, it will tell me I have $50 in checking and $0 in my savings 48 hours later. If I then think to myself, "Oh nice, I have $50 in my checkings account, I'll by a burger for $10!", my card will either be declined or I will have overdrawn by $10, resulting in a $30 dollar overdraft fee (which is also totally absurd). 

Secondly, just today I was using a Rabobank ATM with my Rabobank card, withdrawing cash. Or so I thought, because apparently a RABOBANK ATM DOESNT ACCEPT MY CARD'S BANK? Amazing. You can't make this stuff up. Not only that, but after several attempts, the ATM ate my card and said it needed to be "retained". No call from Rabobank before this occurred, and after 30 minutes of trying to call them and getting put on hold and transferred through robotically manned departments and not ONCE hearing a human voice, I gave up. These people are totally apathetic and incompetent. Do not use Rabobank.

Sally Loo's Wholesome Cafe
The food was delicious and unique. I ordered the grilled cheese and loved it. It was just the right twist on a favorite meal. It came with a good portion of salad with delicious dressing that I wish they sold by the bottle (although I didn't ask so maybe they do). My mom ordered the tuna melt and was just as satisfied. We had the veggie and lentil soup to share and enjoyed that as well and loved the bread that came with it. The tea and coffee was also just as good as the food if not better. Loved everything about this place!

The Best Bud is a grilled sandwich. Chicken, Brie and apples were the highlights of this lunchtime treat. It was paired with a salad drizzled with a mustard dressing. 
I asked for pecans and aoli to be left out of the sand which. It came the the offending allergens inside. It took awhile but they remade it and it was delicious. They threw in a free beverage for the wait.  
This is a popular local spot. A bit out of the way but worth the jaunt.

I had the breakfast burrito with the sausage & caramelized onions with a side of salsa. I could eat that every day it was so good. The salsa has made my top ten list.  ‚ÄúSOOOO GOOD‚Äù

This cafe is truly one of a kind, nestled in the cozy corner of SLO. If you are passing through SLO on highway 101, make some time to stop here for breakfast or lunch to try their awesome farm to table menu. 

I had their breakfast egg burrito and cup of black coffee. The burrito was absolutely delicious, fresh avocado, pinto beans, hash-browns, spinach and egg wrapped in warm tortilla with a side of creamy sauce. 

They have a small outdoor seating area and comfortable open indoor seating.

Great coffees, and really yummy, fresh foods that change with the seasons. Pumpkin waffles are amazing! Off beat location, but cute and convenient to the train station.

Good selection of baked goods and food choices.  Decent coffee, to be honest though the mocha tastes like warm milk. Last 3 tines I went I was thoroughly disappointed with my coffee. For a coffee shop, kind of a bummer. I like hot, robust coffee, somewhat missing those metrics.

The drinks run hot but if you give yourself a minute or two the flavor really comes out. Great staff, great cafe vibe, and so far my fave for coffee in San Luis Obispo.

The staff were nice, the tea was great, and the Blueberry Lemon Poppy seed muffin was amazing!  Will definitely stop in again!

Service is great. Coffee is fair priced. A nice place to sit and visit with no pressure.

The staff at ALL the Blackhorses in town are always super helpful and friendly üòä

Bank of America Financial Center
I came in to speak with a financial advisor around noon. They said she was just about to go on her lunch break and would be back in an hour. They asked if we would like to make an appointment so we made one for 4pm. We got there nice and early and sat in the waiting area while she was with other clients until 4:20. Then she gave us a sideways glance and without saying a word to us she told another client that she was ready to see her. I told her that we had an appointment at 4 and she just said can you come back in tomorrow? I asked what time and she said I could make an appointment at pretty much any time. So I asked why we should make an appointment if they don't mean anything and she said ok just come in whenever. So I asked what time her lunch hour was and she said she wouldn't know until the time comes. I am usually a very patient person but my family is going through a total crisis and we left my dad in the hospital just to make this appointment. The fact that she didn't even bother to say "I'm sorry I'm running behind" or "it looks like we aren't going to be able to keep this appointment" showed a complete disregard to their clients. The fact that we are going to have to go in for a third time for this one thing is unacceptable.

This is a very inefficient bank. And recently they've done away with the merchant window. Always a long line and too few tellers. Even if you have an appointment, they may take someone in front of you if their issues is supposed to take only a short time. If you do all of your banking at the ATM,. this bank could work out fine for you.

This is a great Bank of America location. They have a number of ATMs behind the building and they have a full-time security guard standing right near them. The people in the Bank of very nice and there's always parking. I enjoy coming to the bank when I have any need.

One of the worse bank branches I've ever had to go to! 12 teller stations and never more than two people working - plus they have an express business line so if you are a "special" client, you get to cut in line. For the rest of us peons, we get to watch them cut in front of us!! Average wait time is 15-25 minutes :-(  UPDATE / it's 10-1-2016, Saturday at 9:40am, 40 minutes after they opened - guess what? ONE TELLER WORKING, someone over her shoulder watching while SEVEN customers wait in line... I'm waiting for a good BofA branch to celebrate. In the meantime, here's a perfect example of how a big company needs to look at smaller companies and learn. 

No merchant teller to handle my simple change request.  Extra long line full of people who can easily do their transaction at the ATM.  No lobby director expediting the line as in years past.  Never more than 2 tellers in my past 5 visits.

It seems like it could truly be a wonderful shop, but they keep their own hours, there is absolutely no way to predict if it is even worth it to show up! Their items are wonderful quality, so much so that the best item of clothing I ever owned was from there but sadly was stolen during a trip. I went to return to the shop again many times to see if they have similar items, but I have never been able to purchase anything because during normal working hours, the store is almost -always-closed. How do you expect to run a business this way? Is there some kind of problem? How can you pretend like your store is special and spiritually sound and all this when you don't even care about your customers? Is Hempshak trying to go out of business? As it stands, I think I would have better luck hitchhiking my way to New York with a giant gorilla, twenty-two tons of weoponry and a nuclear bomb. Luckily it's not in my resume, but Thank you and goodnight.

Lovely store! Owner is always super helpful, and the store is full of beautiful art and handcrafted clothing!

Great place to find all types of hemp products in the San Luis Obispo area. Friendly staff always there to answer questions. We purchased some hemp lotion and Hemptopia t-shirts and were very pleased. 

Friendly. Helpful. Unique.

Giuseppe's Cucina Rustica
Very nice atmosphere and excellent food. The staff was all very friendly and accommodating.   
The restaurant was busy on Friday night and we waited an hour.  The manager told me the crowd starts thinning out at around 8 and he was right.  We got there at 6:30 and waited an hour.  It was worth it and I would strongly recommend this place.

Went to this restaurant for a friends graduation. They had our reservation on time and reserved which some places fault on. Our service was excellent and they were constantly keeping the table refreshed with bread and clearing dirty dishes. Our waiter was very professional and knew everything on the menu. 

I had a seafood pasta dish that was perfectly cooked and very tasty. Everyone else also enjoyed their dishes and did not hear any complaints. Desserts were made in house and extremely delicious as well. 

Highly recommend Giuseppe‚Äôs to anyone in the area.

EXCELLENT Italian food! Beautiful outdoor patio dining, great menu, delicious pasta, would 100% recommend. Can't wait to go back! The only place I've ever been too that b instead of just oil and balsamic with parmesan, they had herbs and fresh minced garlic in the dipping mix. So freaking good!!

Best Italian food in SLO.  Like an old time SF Italian restaurant   Will keep coming back for more.  Love this place

Ok...have lunch at a table inside....or the rear patio...or on a sidewalk bistro table! One piece of pizza will fill you up and the salads are amazing.  Great staff too!  On Monterey just a block from the Mission.

========================================================
Cerro Caliente Cellars
The people here are great people!  The wine is definitely a favorite.  Several different varietals available and some incredible blends.  The artwork around the tasting room isn't your typical wineries, it helps liven the place up.  I highly recommend coming here to try when in San Luis Obispo wine tasting.  Also, if you're into cars make sure to come out to their annual car show in July!

Unique wines, great food pairings, can't wait to return !!!

Fun little spot in an industrial area wines are a great value and Don and Mitzi always give amazing service. 

Wow, what a fun, family run wine cellar.  Wonderful wine with a charming atmosphere.  Loved it here!

Central Coast Brewing
Love the Monterey Street ale. Pairs well with jalape√±o chips!  :-)

Craft beer joy. Great selection of beers:ipas stouts, pales and wit. 12 beers on tap on the day and some cans in fridge. 

They do two sizes of growlers for you to take the beer home. The staff were excellent, engaging and attentive. A credit to the town. I have to recommend people to try their beer. Dark side of the Moon is a great stout.

You can buy merchandise and sit outside to have the beer. 

With multiple GABF gold medals,  CCB has established itself as an outstanding brewery!

The peak of beer on the Central Coast. Not a lot of seating space, and no food unless there happens to be a truck, but unquestionably the best beer in SLO.

Super helpful and friendly staff. The beers and sandwiches are fantastic.

========================================================
Koberl At Blue
We enjoyed our anniversary dinner at Koberl. The food, drinks, service and ambiance was excellent.

When it came to dessert the server offered us chocolate lava cake. It was good. We understood the dessert was for our anniversary. We were surprised to see we were billed for it. We paid for it.

An absolute central coast gem. I've been coming here now for almost 10 years and I've never had less than a five star experience. The seasonal specials are dynamic, their bartenders are expert mixologists, the wait staff is knowledge and attentive, you can tell they definitely aren't there for a summer job. Even the vegetarian options are flavorful and considerate given this is a meat heavy town.

It was our 25th anniversary dinner and they treated us exceptionally! From the bar to the table the service was spot on and the dishes were amazing. Olivia our server was a doll and made the experience enjoyable. I highly recommend table 12

I love love this place. Besides the food is incredible.  It makes me feel I‚Äôm home in NYC‚Äôs upper east side.

Great food, service, very good martini,  and a superior menu. I go here when I wanted good food and flawless service.

========================================================
Luis Wine Bar
Not only do they have a great wine selection, but their beer selection is equally as impressive.They usually have 5 rotating taps plus a 30+ bottle selection. I typically find that it's a nice quiet place for an adult conversation, provided there's no pre-scheduled event going on.

Very friendly place with a selection of excellent wines.  We had a flight of white wine and a great meat and cheese plate.  We will definitely be back!

Best staff, best service, best beer selection and best wine selection.

The best!  So much fun wine and beer... Both local and outside of the area.  The 1/2 bottle of champagne is beyond amazing.. great way to upgrade if 2 of you want a glass of bubbles.

Nice cool vibe, friendly. Tori was a great wine guide to the local stuff!

Great place.  Great guy and knowledgeable.

Nice wine shop featuring local wines and beers. Friendly and knowledgeable owner.

Great room in the back of the store to sit and wine taste. Tom is super knowledgeable and great to chat with!  Definitely recommended.

Awesome variety of local wines. Love the little wine tasting area in the back. Reasonably priced too! Hidden gem. 

Tom was fantastic during our tasting...great knowledge of wine and fantastic pallet. He had awesome suggestions for us based on our taste profile.

========================================================
Tap It Brewing Co.
My wife and stopped by for a afternoon beer, and we were pleasantly surprised.  This place is off the beaten track in the airport industrial section of town. 
A nice place, with a good selection of craft beer and snacks. 
If you're a beer afficianido, or just like the occasional beer this place is perfect. Excellent armosphere, with a outside patio. 
They fill growlers for cheap on Thursday's it's good deal.
Lots of events, Wednesday night is geek night for the local tech crowd, music at least once a week.
Good beer joint!

Great service. Love the variety of beers. The atmosphere is great.

Super good beer and super good staff

Ipa is delicious, great place chit s drink with friends

Great setting, plenty of seating, friend staff, and of course...excellent beers. 

========================================================
Creeky Tiki
Mixed. Friendly, but far from prompt service, even coming in at a slow time. Asked to cash out early twice for the bartender so they could get their tip. Food was great, but mixed drinks were extremely weak by all standards. I used to work at a bar myself for years.  Honestly, probably won't go back. Lots of great places to eat that will do better. Good location.

This place was great when I was in school but I visited just recently and it's way different. I was there for 2 for 1s and they were serving in plastic cups instead of glass (very wasteful) so there were huge trash cans full of cups scattered around. Additionally the music was louder and the lighting was lower, making it seem like they were going for a club vibe AND all the cool tiki decor was gone (but they might have just been painting or cleaning, hard to tell). Overall, sad to see this once classy and fun establishment go through such a downgrade.

Great food, amazing atmosphere. Inside and outside dining. Love this place! Great for Sunday football, so I'm told.

Great food great atmosphere and great service a definite repeat

They were out of crown 6pm on a Monday. Food wasn‚Äôt anything special. Bartender let drink run out then took his sweet time to cash me out.

========================================================
Sidecar
This place was quiet on a Sunday morning for brunch. Service was excellent, as well as the food. And the coffee was perfect. I really wanted a breakfast cocktail, but did not partake. Five stars for brunch.

Great place for wonderful cocktails. Tiki Tuesdays are for sure my favorite. The staff knows their stuff and make excellent recommendations.

Whisky and Mezcal you won't find anywhere else between LA and The Bay. Hardworking staff. Great atmosphere. Grown, mature crowd offers refuge from the party crazed masses on Higuera without being uncool or divey. If you want a true cocktail in SLO at a place you can have an actual conversation in, this is it.

Get the french toast if you are here during brunch. Delicious.

Best cocktails and cocktail happy hour (4-6) in SLO.

========================================================
Mo's Smokehouse BBQ
Excellent.  This was one of the best spare ribs I‚Äôve ever had.  They were cooked perfectly and the sides were the best. Rarely to I have baked beans and absolutely love them.  I would go back just for the beans and potato salad it was so good. 
The service was prompt and friendly.  The place was very relaxing and clean.  
I will definitely go back.  Great place.

This is one of the greatest Barbecue places in San Luis Obispo, I really enjoyed my food and the great customer service. Portions are just right, not too much and not too little. I even bought a Shirt with the logo from here, that's how great it was.

The wings were arguably the best in SLO! Enjoyed the tacos too! Beautiful place! It would be great to have a full service bar though...I'll be baaack!

Great BBQ spot in a great intersection.  The building is really great with Windows all around so this is perfect for people-watching while you're eating. Moe's is a San Luis Obispo classic spot. If you're visiting town and looking for great BBQ you can't beat them.

I would rate my visit 1/5. But I usually enjoy mos. I love the food. And it's always super yummy so I can't give you a Terrible star rating.
But today I came in with my service dog. He wasn't wearing his vest at the time because it was left in my other car. And the woman (who was working Monday 5/9 at 3:50pm) told me I could not have my dog. And so I told her he was my service dog. 
And this is were my experience goes down hill. She rolls her eyes at me and says oh okay. 
Then when then next lady came up in line as we were going to sit down. The woman behind the counter says to the customer with quite an attitude. "He's a SERIVICE animal."

My boyfriend showed her his ID card. And there was no apology.

========================================================
Black Sheep Bar & Grill
Great food, excellent service, and they were open on Christmas (which is not normally something that happens in SLO). We had a great time.

Nice small bar with friendly staff.  I usually stop in to have a drink when I am visiting and the staff is always friendly and remebers my drink order, impressive!

Slightly cramped, but good. Great food that tastes great if slightly under presented. Prices a little steep, but as with the area this seems to be the norm.

Good pub. Perfect atmosphere. Ok food. They could expand the beer list

Small pub atmosphere. Music way too loud. Couldn't hear spouse talk.

A French Touch Salon
Every day is a special day for those lucky enough to enjoy a facial at French Touch.  Patricia is knowledgeable and generous with her services, offered in a charming and most relaxing atmosphere.   I am never ever  disappointed in her services!

I love this salon--Patricia gives the best facials ever.  The products, by Sothys, are amazing and the atmosphere is serene and pleasant.  I always leave feeling wonderfully relaxed and rejuvenated.

Patricia Kaspian is the best esthetician on the Central Coast and the main reason you want to go to A French touch salon. Before she opened her own salon I used to see Patricia and her two previous places of employment. Wherever she goes I go! The salon is conveniently located on a quiet edge of downtown San Luis Obispo along the creek. The atmosphere is professional, relaxing, peaceful, and elegant. There is an authentic French touch as Patricia comes from a French family and had traveled to France many times. Also, her mother was a reputable esthetician in the bay area, so she has grown up south the practice of excellent skin care. The main product lines carried in the salon are Sothys (French) and Jan Marini (Californian). Both are excellent, and I use products from each line. Throughout the year Patricia organizes product events with company representatives that are always fun and informative, not to mention she always provides delicious and elegant high quality refreshments. I look forward to my regular facials with Patricia. They are always an enjoyable and relaxing time, and they help keep my skin in top notch condition.

I've been going in for organic French garden facials since the salon opened last spring.  This is the best I've looked in ten years.  Patricia knows everything under the sun about skin care, and she genuinely cares about her clients.  Highly recommended.  Thank you!

Fantastic Sams Cut & Color
I had a great experience here. The girl spent almost two hours getting my hair perfect. She did not stop until I was completely satisfied with my cut. Great service and inexpensive. 

They do haircuts and color plus styling.

Very disappointed with my haircut. Would NOT recommend ANYONE!

Excellent service

Used to be great price, good cut. But last time I went the cut cost just as much as at my regular salon (being broke, I was trying to avoid that expense), and it was so bad ... I'm just waiting for it to grow out so I can get it cut by my regular girl.

McDonald's
Kinda like the McDonald's of the future. Cool interior design, clean, excellent Customer Service. Open 24hrs. Good place to just buy a soda, coffee, or a bite to eat and just kick back and read a paper or "hit the school books'


I called and asked if they would have sezechuan sauce. They said they had sezechuan sauce. They never had sezechuan sauce. They'll never have sezechuan sauce.

Used the 'order here' kiosk thinking the order would get in quickly, but I was wrong. People coming in after us recieved their order before ours. More disappointing was they put cheese on a quarter of my sons chicken sandwich, who has sensory issues and will not eat food if he sees cheese on it. We definitely will not return unless it's for soft drinks.

Always friendly.  Always cleaning out waiting on customers.  Great deals on sodas and ice cream.  Salads are good.  

I called this location to see if they were doing any specials. The woman that answered could not speak English. Sad location. I won't be going to this location ever!

Phoenix Books
Nice little used book store. Exactly what you'd expect, stacks of books lining the floors and the walls, going up the staircases. I love the smell of the place.
Not much reading in other languages other than the occasional book. Lots of old paperback westerns.
I find myself in this store every few weeks to explore and find something new to read.

Excellent, eclectic and ever-changing selection of used and antique books. Always worth a stop.

A book lovers' paradise, with piles of books and shelves that are bursting at the edges with amazing reading material.

Love visiting this book store!  Floor to ceiling books! A sight to be seen for sure. If you are a book lover, your jaw will drop at the shear numbers of books. We usually stop in anytime we are in SLO. 

Phoenix is great if you go in to browse, you'll most likely always find something cool to pick up. Go in looking for a specific title and most likely you'll walk away empty handed. The staff is great, always helpful and pretty knowledgeable.

Del Monte Cafe
Can't believe I've lived in the area for several years and had never been to Del Monte Cafe until last weekend. I went for breakfast on Sunday and had the vegetarian eggs benedict. Wow, the food was flavorful and filling. Although the service was a little slow, the staff were all friendly. I'll definitely be back

Love this place! Home-style goodness that warms the belly. Great patio to enjoy the beautiful SLO days with breakfast or lunch. This is the first place each of our children went to after they were born. So much love for Del Monte

Got the "southwest" chorizo scramble. Delicious! Good service & nice small town diner type feeling.

Dropped in for ice cream after getting off Amtrak for a short layover. Picked up a vanilla shake instead. They ran out of chocolate ice cream, which is what I really wanted. The waitress was courteous and fast. There were a few people in the outside eating area and their food looked delicious when it was plated to be served--some avocado slices neatly arrange on top. The place was clean and neat with a 50's/60's flair. If we had more time, we would have eaten there.

Went here with the kids after swim lessons, it was a bit of a lark... we all came away very satisfied per the meal, and we he kids loved the nostalgic diner experience.  The building sort of throws you back in time a bit, but the service was great.  My only complaint was the flies, not to many but enough that it was a little annoying.

Cole Chrysler Dodge Jeep
After our first visit I was frustrated, we went to look around and not one person was around to help us with the car we were very interested in purchasing. That changed after getting everything going with Jay. He was nice and helpful and in the end we left with the car we had our eye on. I was pleased with our overall experience and would gladly work with Jay again!

Jay could not have made it any easier and simple. So nice and helpful explained the car in detail honest and upfront. Dave the finance manager so good at his job also we were done so quickly it was so nice. I think this was the easiest and fastest car deal we have ever done. THANK YOU COLE CHRYSLER DODGE.

Last few service experiences were quite sub standard. They charged for service which they did not deliver. We took the car elsewhere
and found out Cole was unreliable and 
failed to service what we went in for.
Foolishly returned for an express oil change.
Waited at the counter 15 munutes for the service person. They did not fill the fluids,
Spilled oil inside the car and to add insult to injury, increased their price by 30%.
Their estimates on brake repair differed by
125.00 for the exact parts and labor.
Even their tax rate calculation was inconsistent.

Service manager was only interested in excuses, offered nothing for having spilled oil in the car. Tried to justify what were clearly arbitary estimates. I find them to be dishonest, unreliable and unprofessional.
In the very least, inspect to see if they did what you were charged for and thoroughly check your invoice calculations.
Best - go elsewhere.

I've been here a few times over the years. Sales staff for vehicles are pretty typical but helpful. Prices were decent but not great when I was looking for a Jeep. 
Parts department is well stocked and I've been able to get some very random small parts and they had them in Stock. 

"Traded in my Ram 2500  Diesel in pristine condition with super low miles for a jeep wrangler once I saw what they turned around and posted my RAM for I immediately felt ripped off and taken advantage of as they posted it for 8k higher than what they gave me for it. i know they need to make a profit but they could have been more fair and balanced on the trade in price.. Felt very unfair for them to do this especially for a returning MOPAR customer that support domestic car manufacturers. I am a blue collar worker that values the dollar I work hard to get. I felt like Cole reached into my pocket and took more money that what they really may have, "

Peet's Coffee
The thermostat seems to be stuck at the oddly low temperature of a back-kitchen freezer, but other than that, coffee enthusiasts from all cups of life can appreciate the diversity in their selections. Aside the minimal effort in serving anything other than coffee, this is a great place for socializing and enjoying some good brew

For being a coffee house chain in a sea of local coffee houses, this place holds its own. Stephanie took my complicated order with no problems at all, and Bailey made it to perfection. My order was a large iced nonfat vanilla latte with sugar free syrup and one pump of white chocolate. The drink had the perfect amount of foam and flavor. I will absolutely return for my next coffee fix.

I have yet to have there actual coffee but there teas are definitely 5 star worthy. Whether it be hot or cold the, sweet or unsweetened the teas are good.

Best coffee we have tasted in this country.. sorry the are not everywhere... but so happy there are a few .. while traveling we look for Peets first.... even the decaf is fantastic.. enjoy Major Dickensen blend.. and their house blend..

Calm and nice place in downtown SLO to enjoy a good coffee and pastries. The staff is super nice.

Kim & Co Salon & Day Spa
Lovely salon I popped and in for a blow out and they were great! 
Lovely staff, Kim is really smart and kind, beautiful salon lit by orchids and smiling faces.
Make up and wedding hair stuff a must!

Melissa Elguera did my wedding day hair, and she was truly awesome! She's very talented and surprisingly fast at updos. She seriously does a better job than other stylists in the area in half the time. I highly recommend Melissa for wedding day hair!

Kim & Co is a beautiful salon, they do all services and are very nalajable

I started going to Kim for my hair needs the summer before my wedding. She is AMAZING. I have never had such a good cut in my life. I have very thick straight hair but she was able to make it look wonderful with out a lot of styling after I left. She put beautiful highlights in it for me too and I always got exactly what I asked for. This is not a hair artist that takes liberties with your hair, you get what you ask for the first time! All of the staff is very friendly and accommodating as well.

She did my hair and make-up for my wedding and I would not have had it any other way. I've gotta say I think I looked pretty awesome! 

One of the girls did my nails for my wedding as well, I had no idea what she did was even possible! I had no idea they could take straight glitter and do just the tips of my nails! I even got to pick three different glitters to mix together and she made them "fade" the way I wanted them to.

Two of my bridesmaids had they're hair done for the wedding by two other stylists and they were very happy with the results as well.

I would recommend them to any one! 

Kim is the best, attentive and professional but always friendly with a smile.

Gennaro's Grill & Garden
I loved my experience here at Gennaro's! My boyfriend and I stopped in on New Year's Eve hopeful for a cancellation. Delightfully enough for us (to the sorry luck of some couple with the flu- please get better!) we were able to have a window seat where we enjoyed a delightful antipasto plate, wine and the most satisfying dessert of flowerless chocolate cake that was made with complete excellence! Service was perfection and the atmosphere can not be beat! Will 100% be back!

The ambiance is great. Small converted small Victorian house. The night we were there was extremely quiet. However either my chair or the floor was leaning. The food was good but nothing extraordinary or the quality that would bring me back.

The food was excellent as was the service.  Ate lamb chops best I have ever eaten.  Great wine selection, flour less chocolate cake to die for.

My wife,granddaughter&i had dinner on saturday nite...the meals were outstanding!!!

We have been coming to Splash, since it opened in San Luis Obispo, Ca. The chowder bowl is delicious! The pastries are incredible, too. You get a wonderful sourdough bowl, filled to the brim with hot chowder, bring your appetite!

Clippers
The staff is very helpful and friendly. They always try their best and are very accommodating. Professionals, I‚Äôve never had a bad cut and I‚Äôve been going regularly for over 3 years. Great atmosphere and people, the service is top-notch.

Always got a good cut here. Friendly service.

This modern twist on a barber shop is really cool. The interior has a great theme and the people are quite nice. Make sure you make an appointment as they are always crowded. The haircut quality is pretty good, but sometimes there have been minor mistakes.

Get the VIP, you won't be sorry. I've been a client for over 7 years and wouldn't go anywhere else.

Get my haircuts here, cold beer, and nice people!

Big Sky Cafe
I've been eating at this restaurant for over 15 years and is is usually a great place to eat! Lots of vegetarian options and the locals know the cornbread muffins are the bomb! Easy downtown location and the restaurant has a nice open feel to it. Staff are super friendly and will do their best to make it a good experience.

Always great. Had the turkey chili. Wonderful flavors but not spicy enough for me. Always great service and food is always fresh.

A popular and vibrant spot to stop for delicious and healthy options. I was impressed with their gf and vegan selection. I got the hominy stew and was full and happy.

Amazing place for Brunch and comfortable atmosphere...a must visit for each time I am in SLO. Staff are friendly and always have a smile. Can be very busy, be prepared to wait a few minutes for a table but worth the wait!

Great food. Friendly service. Welcoming casual ambience. Slightly pricey.

Frog & Peach Pub
I enjoy playing music here with my band STIG

Great atmosphere, local bands, lots of beer on tap

Gets crowded around 10 every night regardless of month

Great patio, great staff, great live music! It's pretty great!

My go to bar downtown San Luis Obispo.  They have Pint Night on Tuesdays, good beer for a fair price.  Seating in the back is limited, so if you plan on hanging out back there I suggest getting there before 10:30 pm.  After 10:30 pm the outdoor area can fill up quickly.   The staff is very friendly, every time I go in I am greeting with smiles and handshakes.

Favorite bar in San Luis Obispo. Good prices on good beers, good atmosphere, great music, no cover unless a band is playing, and most bands there are great.

Often used that station in order to ride down to L.A. Union station to catch the LAX Fly Away bus.
Ticket for me and bike purchased the day before. Better this way to avoid stress in the morning.

Fantastic staff. Bob was very helpful and clearly had good knowledge of his occupation.

Well if you have to ride Amtrak you don't have a choice so who cares about reviews? Overall a beautiful station, has long term parking, good location. Note if you plan to ride the Amtrak Surfliner, the best railroad mileage in the nation is between here and Santa Barbara. As of 2017 you will pay $30-ish to ride that short trip (2 stops) and you'll pay about the same to ride all the way to Burbank or LA Union Station. I was harrassed by Manny who likes to enforce rules that don't exist and he hates railroad photographers. I'll post the video soon-ish, search SLO Amtrak Manny with your favorite expletive and you'll find Manny. He's the reason this station lost three stars.

Quiet, friendly. No cafe, no wi-fi.

Clean. Friendly staff. Adequate seating. No complaints.

Spike's Pub
Outstanding brew selection with continuous additions/changes. Friendly bartenders, table service if desired. Nice laid-back atmosphere. I especially like the fact that music and ambient noise level is usually low enough to actually hold a conversation! Sometimes a little noisier during happy hour, but quiets down a bit thereafter.

I always have a good time at Spikes. I hope it never changes

Food is okay, and their beer selection changes frequently

Go for the great beer (and decent cider) detection. But, for the love of God, stay away from the food. I've gotten food poisoning here a couple times, and so has my boyfriend and an ex-coworker. Ordering food here is a real crapshoot... pun intended, as that's what will be shooting out of you.

Cool place, good food and a solid beer selection.

Fun for bowling but the management is really mean. Our friend accidentally wore his shoes outside of the building and was fine with paying for them but the man working the register was pissed and dropping f-bombs every other sentence. Calm down dude, he paid you back. (It's the guy with the crutches/knee brace)

Great place love the bowling I love the staff great food I will go there again

Pretty much one of the only places around to play bowling if you're up for it.

This place is absolutely demeaning. They hold your shoes hostage and force you to stand shoeless while your group pays. And the locale is gaudy. 

Often full of children, but otherwise a fine place to bowl

Salon 544
I've been going to Sherry for about 6 years and she is awesome.

Many places I had been to in the past had an odd procedure of washing your hair -- and then when your hair is soaked and plastered to your head -- they ask what you want to do.  Um well... I could have showed you before it was washed, but now it's kind of hard to describe...  

Sherry always does an interview with you while your hair is combed in the style you walked in with -- and then after discussing what you want she takes you back to get it washed.

She's so good that lately I just tell her to do whatever she thinks looks good and every time it comes out great. She really pays attention to the little things that makes YOUR hair unique.

Conversation during the hair cut is never forced or awkward, it's very fun and natural, like we're sitting having coffee together.  The salon has a very comfortable feel and everything is always clean.

544 and Sherry are just great in every way,

I've been going to Alison for 11 yrs. & have always been very happy with her services. Very comfortable atmosphere & I love the decor‚ù§Ô∏è

I love my haircut! I just recently moved to town and getting a new haircut is as scary as going to a new dentist for the first time...really! I did not want an everyday type of generic cut, nor did I want it punky and wild. I wanted simple and artistic. Jessica at Salon 544 gave me just what I needed. The salon is cozy - as if you're visiting an old friend. I recommend it highly! Great staff, and great talent!

I have dark mousy brown hair that I hate. But Jessica makes me into a beautiful blonde and when I leave Salon 544 I feel AMAZING.  It looks so natural and feels so soft!  I LOVE IT.  Jessica is a sweetheart. Plus the salon is so quaint and comfortable, it was a really good experience. Two thumbs up!!

Great place to get a cut.

I absolutely love bookstores, and as Barnes and nobles go, this one is superb!  Never had the coffee but the staff is great and it is always clean!  Make sure to check out all the sale/clearance areas!  I can spend hours here discovering new authors and browsing different sections.  I have always been able to find good nature/science books and field guides, the sci do section is great, and don't forget to check out all the board games!

Really enjoy bringing the kids here for books. An in-store Starbucks, and all the books you need, it's easy to spend a couple of quality hours with the kids, or finding a book that is just for you. The is friendly, but not bugging you about "how long" you've been there. And should you need a little help finding something specific, there is always someone close by to help you.

There was absolutely no staff on the floor ( upstairs or down) to assist and when we finally found an info station it was at the end of the checkout line so we were blocking the people leaving. The girl that helped me was pleasant enough however I was looking for 2 books that are Barnes and Noble Classics, they don't carry them in store...what? They are B and N branded! Not a pleasant experience.

Very helpful and friendly staff. The store itself is also very clean and organized. Out of all the barns and nobels I've been to, this is one of my favorites! I go every time I'm in town

Great location near everything downtown. Nice coffee nook upstairs with a great view for reading or working on laptop.  Awesome selection of magazines,  kids books,  and much more.  Usually not very busy and friendly staff.  Also great prices and sales all the time.

Toyota San Luis Obispo
We take the car in every three months. Three times we left got on the freeway and shortly after that the car started digging and beeping. We called they said come back. Turns out it was a reset button they forgot to push. Otherwise happy with our service. They are open on Saturday and very timely. Great job guys!

I went to this dealership on Tuesday, there we're 2 gentleman leaning on a truck busy on their cell phones, never bothered looking up. I wandered the lot for more than 20 minutes, another gentleman walked past me twice, not one of them bothered asking if I needed help or anything. Won't ever bother coming to your business as you don't need to help customers and sell a new vehicle.

Toyota San Luis Obispo: I brought in my 4Runner Limited Edition to replace the oxygen sensor. Driving the truck two years, 20,000 miles, I had ZERO other problems. When a friend dropped me off so I could pickup the truck it was in the Toyota service yard with the doors unlocked and my key in the ignition. I went in and paid for the oxygen sensor work and then drove the truck home, the key still in the ignition switch where Toyota left it. When I got home I found that I could not remove the ignition key, or lock the ignition or steering column, or arm the security system. Toyota SLO denies causing a new problem and now denies they left the truck unlocked in the service yard with the key in the ignition: Steve, the service manager now states, "We always lock all vehicles after the service has been completed and the keys are left on our key board. This is our delivery process that we adhere to."

Think twice before you go to Toyota San Luis Obispo.

I took my Corolla in for 3 recall repairs. From the phone call to the drop-off/pick-up experience to the follow-up call the next week from a friendly lady who was just checking to see if everything had gone well, it was top notch. The adviser, Chris Hidgon, couldn't have been more polite and knowledgeable. I wanted some add-on work done in conjunction with the recall work and he actually recommended other work to be done instead of what I wanted. It was actually cheaper and he explained to me why he recommended it, etc. The car has not run better since I bought it new. Don't believe the horrible reviews on this service department...and believe me, I am the FIRST one to be critical if some business screws something up.

Quick and efficient. I'm not sure about price. But I prefer mechanics who are masters of Toyotas

========================================================
Art's Cyclery
They went the extra mile to install a new seatpost collar on a dropper post to get me back on the trail. Always helpful staff and good prices and availability for all parts.

Excellent experience with customer service: Purchased a 2016 Intense Spider 275C a few months ago which had issues right off the bat with sticky levers on the Guide RS brakes and vertical sag issue on the Reverb Stealth dropper.  Worked with Connor and Kyle to get refunds on the labor charged by LBS (parts were covered by SRAM under warranty) and/or gift card to cover my out-of-pocket costs.  Took several weeks to get the bike all sorted out but now it rips.  Thanks a lot guys and I would highly recommend Art's Cyclery for future purchases/service.

Awesome experience! I have taken my bike in 2 times, for a break tune up, and a loose cassette and both times everyone was very friendly and helpful. Didn't even charge me. I also returned a bike lock that I bought from there that I had foolishly broken and they replaced it without any hassle. I will definitely be coming back again!

1st time Customer. Super folks to deal with. Everything went off as promised. Great pre-delivery communication. Love the Catlike Leaf helmet. Will purchase a new road helmet later this summer. Thank you

I went in early Saturday for a quick wheel repair.  Service was great and staff were extremely knowledgeable.

========================================================
Supercuts
Pleased with the haircut given to my 14 yr old boy. More importantly he liked it. Less than pleased that I had to endure listening to pop country music while there.

I have been getting my hair cut here for over twenty years. Supercuts used to be on the other side of the shopping center by the theatre. The staff are always friendly and I have never had a bad experience.

Very satisfied with my cut. I had my hair cut and layered. Most places try to convince me not to cut my long hair; I always leave feeling like I look the same. The girl helped me with what I wanted and did a great job. 

I always request Angelica. I don't have the best hair and it's easy to mess up but Angelica is great. She is very meticulous and fast. 

My hair looked good, I just felt like it was a bit rushed. Overall, very pleased. I would recommend this Supercuts.

========================================================
Starbucks
Small store with limited seating but you can't be the service and the Starbucks employees know you by name and remember your face.

Great service, just a small store so few seating options indoors.  They do have seats outside though so that opens things up in warm weather.

Salted caramel mocha extra good when they add a light sprinkle of salt to the blendüòô.

Quick in & out. Not too many wierdos.

Great service and all the workers always have a smile on their faces. Bathrooms are nice too and CLEAN! 

========================================================
Coastal Peaks Coffee
First impression is that they look the same as your high end coffee bar. But, do not be fooled by its' cover. They have extremely high standards.  Their coffee making is an art form! Warning, if you visit this place no other place ever will do!

First visit at new location. Very busy at 2:30. Trendy crowd. Limited coffee menu, but welcoming atmosphere and friendly staff.

Great coffee shop with a very nice staff. Very open an comfortable.

Usually pretty busy. But great service and yummy coffee

With good coffee being commonplace now, does it really matter which one I stop at?  YES!    This place was a coffee roaster first, selling specially blended coffee to restaurants, and their coffee is great!  They then opened the cafe and made it a super casual, comfortable place.  Don't let that fool you, though, the staff are relaxed but they are really working for you, just making it look easy.  It must be a good place to work!  And the roaster now gets to do single origins and new blends, whatever the beans seem to want, this has got to be more fun than blending for the same restaurants every week.

Bluebird Salon
Evan Anthony is by far the best stylist in SLO!

Loved my haircut, main complaint was that my stylist was 15 minutes late for my appointment. I was also put on a different stylist's schedule than I had originally scheduled with and no one told me. Luckily it was my first visit and I didn't know either stylist, but it still seemed weird to me.  Lastly I found the stylist to be a bit condescending when I mentioned I preferred a style requiring "minimal maintenance" as well as when I mentioned the fact that it had been a long time since I had gotten my hair cut. I left feeling happy but slightly judged and deflated by the staff.

Adorable atmosphere with highly qualified stylists. Haircuts run about $50 and they work hard to fit your schedule and what you're looking for. Finding a good parking spot to access his place is the hardest thing you'll encounter. They have always been on time with my appointment. Great spot for Bumble and Bumble products.

I love this salon!  I feel like a princess when I walk in AND out of there.  They offer you drinks while you wait, you are pampered by some of the most talented hair stylist around and you leave there looking so much better than you did before you walked in the door.  I can't say enough about them.  I adore this place and all the people who work here.

Repeated visits once I received MULTIPLE COMPLIMENTS

Foothill Cyclery
The service at this shop is second to none!  My daughter had a serious crash in October and the integrity of her helmet post-crash was in question.  The guys at this shop brought it to my attention that her Bontrager helmet came with a one year warranty for replacement due to a crash and they traded hers on the spot.  I was set to purchase a new one and they took the high road!   My daughter is getting a new bike, and a brand-new helmet for Christmas!  Shop Local and shop at this store!   Thank you Foothill Cyclery our story has had a very happy ending!

Love. This. Shop. 

I‚Äôve purchased all of my bikes (4 treks, 2 surlys) and have had other bikes serviced here over the past 9 years, meaning I‚Äôve done all kinds of business with them, and they‚Äôve never missed an opportunity to exceed my expectations. 

One of my favorite aspects of their service is the transparency. They‚Äôve never glossed over something they didn‚Äôt want to explain because I‚Äôm not a bicycle expert- they‚Äôve always taken the time to explain a problem or a solution before I decide to commit any money. And they‚Äôve always managed to explain it in a way that shows their passion for their craft without making you feel clueless. 

On the flip side of that, if you don‚Äôt want to know about the inner workings of your bottom bracket, they will simply take care of it in a very reasonable amount of time. 

So if you‚Äôre in need of a quality shop for the purchasing and maintainence of your various bicycles, definitely go see Josh and his crew at Foothill Cyclery.

Great service from super friendly and knowledgeable staff- I rented my first proper mountain bike, a demo Trek Fuel for just  $60 for the day. The guys spent time setting it up for me as a newbie, and took time to explain some suitable beginner trails as well as some local technical spots for my experienced rider boyfriend. I loved it! Thanks for making mtb accessible to a first timer girl!

These guys are nothing but professional. Passing through touring on a tight budget and they got me going no problem.

Foothill Cyclery definitely has the best service in town! Their mechanics and floor staff are highly knowledgeable and friendly. The turnaround on bike service is almost always one day or less. They also rent full-suspension mountain bikes which is awesome! Always a good experience at Foothill.

San Luis Obispo County Builder
The bike coalition is strongly supported by hundreds of local members and all area bike shops.  Staff teaches safe cycling, monitors local governments, and drives funding efforts.  So far the coalition has achieved remarkable success with bike lanes and paths popping up all over.  The number of people leaving their cars parked and biking to work or shopping has followed suit.  Its a green critical mass and everyone benefits.  Those who do choose to drive have less auto traffic and more convenient parking - everyone has cleaner air to breathe.

========================================================
McCarthy's Irish Pub
Great local place, outdoor seating. Fine selection of Irish Whiskey. Many beers on draft, shuffleboard,  jukebox. Excellent bartenders...

A good place to drink Jameson's. They were the largest Jameson's distributor in the U.S.  so clearly they cater to the Irish Whiskey lovers. The staff is friendly and attentive. We stop every time we're in town.

Best bar in town. Ask paddy for the best bloody Mary in town. He works Sundays early.

Dive bar hole in the ground with interesting clientele. However the whiskey was good and service ok.

Good people. Good prices. Bomb jukebox tunes.

Alfano Motorcars - Mercedes-Benz | Chevrolet | Sprinter Dealership
I am specifically writing this review for sales man Justin at Alfano Motorcars. I'm for the first time looking for a higher end vehicle. I appreciate how Justin handled me throwing at him the "I have no clue what I was looking for". He was relaxed, non-annoyed, no pressure & in no rush. Most of all I really appreciate Justin not 'dumbing' down car/engine talk with me & treating me like I feel he would have treated a potential male client. You wouldn't guess by looking at me but a feminine looking woman that has been trained as both an automotive & diesel mechanic. Too many females HATE to shop for vehicles by themselves due to being taken advantage of & being treated as if we are clueless. I highly commend Justin & if I do end up purchasing a Benz I will definitely be going through Justin. Thank You.

I have been looking for a good Toyota car for a long time and Alfano Motorcars had just the car I had been looking for.  I found a great car online but it was in the very top of my price range.  Thanks to Justin, I was able to get this car with a little room to spare.  He was able to answer all of our many questions and he addressed any of our concerns.  Because of Justin, we had an amazing car buying experience!

This place is great! Had the best dealership experience so far. Quick and easy buying. They get your the best price and lowest interest rate. Jacob is a really nice,energetic and patient person who cares about his costumers. Make sure to ask for him on your next visit.

Update: Changing from 2 stars to 1 star.

Mercedes Financial called me back to let me know that Jacob and his manager refused to cover the last payment. The rep at Mercedes Financial spoke to his supervisor and Mercedes Financial is taking care of the last payment to make this right. I would highly suggest that in the future Alfano try and at least understand the perception of the customer instead of outright refusing to honor something that in my opinion was implied before I even purchased the new car. It's ridiculous that they would prefer I drive an hour and half for a $50 tank of gas (which would cost me $20 in gas round trip) rather than pay a $140 payment. I'm never going up there as I have no reason to drive that far to get gas, which means they lost me, anyone I might have referred and got a bad review all over $90.

Update: Changing from 5 stars to 2 stars.

When I called to inquire about the new car Jacob clearly asked me when the lease on my current vehicle ended. When I said I had one payment left he responded that it would be "no problem". I've turned in many leases that only had 1 or 2 payments left and I've always had the dealership pay off the lease since I was either leasing or buying another vehicle from them. Anyway, to make a long story short, I got a bill for the final payment, called and left a message with all the details so they could correct their oversight, then got a call back from Jacob telling me I must have misunderstood him. Why would I not have waited 3 more weeks to finish out my lease when I only had one payment left if I wasn't sure the dealership would pay the last payment? The payment was only $140...and on top of that the dealership owes me a tank of gas since my new car had less than a quarter tank when I drove off the lot. I live about an hour and half away from the dealership so there is no way I'm driving up there to fill my tank. And to really get me ticked off, Jacob mentioned they did me a huge favor in letting me mail them my second key for the car I turned in...but we're pretty much square on that in my eyes since they forgot to give me the second key for my new car and had to mail it to me. So for less than $100 they now have an offended and disappointed customer. I didn't want to get into an argument with Jacob so I hung up. I've called Mercedes Benz Financial to let them deal with it.
_______________________________________________________________________  
Original review:

I called to come in and turn in my leased vehicle and also purchase a CPO C250 that I had pretty much already decided on. I spoke with Jacob a few times over the phone in advance and then drove up from Santa Barbara to work with him to purchase the car shortly after. Although he was new to the dealership he was very hospitable, honest, professional and quick. Was literally the fastest vehicle transaction I've ever experienced which is amazing considering I was also turning in a lease. Everyone I worked with was extremely helpful and went out of there way to accommodate me. I absolutely love my car and I 100% recommend them if you are in the market for a Mercedes!

Recently bought a E350 CPO convertible from these folks.  We recently moved to Nipomo from Los Angeles, and are amazed how friendly people are.  We worked with Leo and Justin, and they were great.  Helpful and not pushy.  Hank, the finance lady was great too.  They made buying a car almost non-streeful.  Service so far has been helpful also.  I will gladly refer friends to Alfano in the future.

Auto Park Superstore Used Cars
Auto Park Superstore was outstanding.  Thank you very much.  It was a pleasure working with Juan and Brian. We have used Auto Park Superstore for service of our 2010 Highlander for 3-4 years.  We are loyal customers.  That's why we continue to come back.

I appreciate the patience and time spent ensuring that we got the right deal.  I would absolutely return when looking for another vehicle.  (Even with two screaming children.)  I think the service here has been outstanding!  Thank you.

Garret, Juan, and Brian have all been fantastic people to deal with.  I am very happy to have purchased my new Tacoma at Auto Park Superstore Used Cars.  Very professional service and an excellent experience all around.  Thanks for making my first new vehicle purchase a great experience!

Great service/sales Rico was excellent at reviewing all details and technical information of operations.  Guys in financing were complete and thorough getting the financing in place.  I have remained a loyal customer for many years.

I was able to negotiate a great trade-in and deal within 1 week.  It was great to have my vehicle ready to go so quickly.

Cal Poly University Store
Great place to get a tour! Super friendly students and alumni. Really get the sense of an inclusive environment and ability to grow! Learn by doing for sure!

Long lines, but they move relatively quick something are expensive and some are really cheap

Great selection of Cal Poly apparel and accessories, prices are a bit high but that is expected for a campus store.

Nice products and plenty of options. 

Great university bookstore with competitive prices and a great staff. :-)

Starbucks
Friendly baristas. Always good service.

Once -just once- I would love it if they could get my order right.
Venti soy latte, no foam.
It's NOT that hard.
It's NOT that complicated. 
It's clearly NOT in the realm of capabilities for them.

My favorite location to go to, mainly because it's close to my work. Staff is always super friendly and courteous. Busy most of the time, but they're super fast!

Baristas are really nice and fast!

Convenient location near highway and campus. Fast service.

Appendage + Bough
Such a cool and unique addition to the vintage and home-goods shops in San Luis Obispo. And it's not just vintage... They have new items in all the time. The custom made furniture is really cool as well. And well-priced for a one-of -a-kind piece! Also, the owners are maybe the nicest guys around. Stop by for a casual conversation and check out their ceramic place settings, really cool outdoor stuff from Poler, jewelry, candles, etc!

Perry Ford Lincoln of San Luis Obispo
Happy that these guys are willing to do what it takes to be fair with their customers!  It means a lot and is much appreciated!

My car had a safety recall so I set up an appointment for the service and the representative  gave me a time slot about 16 days out. So I  told the rep I needed to have several other service items addresed. When I arrived at the appointment I might as well never have made an appointment. The service representatives handled all customers on a first come first serve method and if a attractive woman arrived, she was quickly put to the front of the list.There is absolutely no organization or system in place to provide quality or timely customer service. I was not treated as a valued customer was told to order the part(s) and bring it in myself to have it installed.

Great experience! The sales people, Brian & Darrell were very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Plus they never pressured us. We felt comfortable purchasing our car and they also helped us with a used car too.

I called to make an appointment for my husbands company car.  The bluetooth would not sync and is under warranty.  The first available appointment time was 7 days later,  on a Monday.  When I brought the car in, I stood in  a line - not sure if this was the right line.  Nobody acknowledged any of the customers in this line.  

After Ford has the car for 2 days later, (I hadn't hear from anyone) I called.  They said someone would call back.  Nobody called.  On Friday after 2 additional calls, I was transferred to the representative.  He said the had "my paperwork in hand" and was just about to call me. (Last time we had the car in, after several calls to them, they said this exact thing).  The representative said the part had just gotten in and did I wanted to have the part installed - so the phone would sync.  I said I would and that I had had no communication at all from Ford, I didn't know a part was needed.  He said it should be done soon and he would contact me.  On Monday morning (7 days later) I called and asked to talk with the representative for the car.  The receptionist said the car was done.  NO ONE NOTIFIED ME.  I asked to talk to a manager - I left a voice mail for him.  He did call me back, I was unable to answer and called him back.  He never got back to me - 3 days later.

I met with Mike Barnes, and I honestly can say that he made my car buying experience fantastic!! Right away my questions were addressed In finding the very best answers that were ideal to my requests and needs. I am VERY PLEASED with his service. a positive experience. The courtesy he had shown to me really came to be genuine. Thanks, Mike!  
   Nilton, I am also very pleased with as well! Thanks for taking the time to talk with me and show me kindness when it was only possible for me to come in during the late eve. Knowing we were all tired. There wasnt any Back and forth or a moment I second guessed any of it during sign time. Thank you!
   To the ones I didnt get to meet but will definitely praise...,the detail crew and shop help, that took that shine and kicked it up a lot! You guys stayed late and one guy came in when he was off-amazing job. Please know your attention to detail was spot on! Thank you all! It helps to know that where I live work and purchase comes around full circle.

The Bladerunner Salon & Day Spa
Simply Fabulous! I have my hair done there for years~Todd is the best. I also have my eye lashes and brows tinted, there's no place better in San Luis Obispo. The spa side is lovely, quiet, a cocoon of serenity. Terrific  massages. It seems like there is a salon on every corner in SLO these days, but none of them hold a candle to the best. Bladerunner. 
Great location, walking distance from everywhere in town.  A full retail line of product quality products. 
I highly recommend. 
BTW, I think it's very unfair that some random person posted a picture through the window after the salon closed, clearly, with the garbage cans visible. They should take that down!
The salon is beautifully decorated, and impeccably clean. Friendly service. The owners are present and hands on.

I LOVE BLADERUNNER,  THE FRONT DESK PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY,  ALWAYS A SMILING WELCOME.  AND TODD IS THE BEST!  HE CUTS MY HAIR BEAUTIFULLY,  AND DOES GREAT COLOR.  CANNOT SAY ANYTHING BUT THE BEST ABOUT EVERYONE THERE.

First timer at blade runner salon after going to faces ala mode and two hair screw ups from there people be warned DO NOT go to faces way over priced terrible service rude stylists I found Thai at blade runner salon and what a find! He was fantastic very professional reasonable prices I was so happy with my hair I nearly cried finally after all this time a great one he's the best thanks Thai I will definitely be back!

Meghan is my girl!  Can't go anywhere else but to her.

I had previously won a hundred dollar gift card at a Bridal Event, and I was in SLO for the weekend to find a dress. Perfect opportunity to use the card to buy things at their store! We walked in and we were greeted, the salon is really nice. I picked out 6 things to buy with my gift card and my card. My sister saw a sign that said Free gift for birthdays and first time in the store, she innocently asked if that applied to us, just being curious. The girl checking us out didn't know (she was very sweet) and she went to ask a guy with brown hair who was working on someone. He was very rude, I mean rolling his eyes rude and scoffing saying that it's for people getting services done. She walked back and the whole time he was staring at us like we were idiots. I wanted to cry, who works with people on a daily basis and doesn't know how to respond right to others.  I got checked out, and she took my number in case I ever came back and I let her know I would never return. That kind of ugliness really hit me hard when I left. Hope no one ever books with him, and I wish I had a name!!

Smith Volvo, Inc
I LOVE MY 2014 HONDA ODYSSEY TOURING ELITE!!  The Sales Associate Gary and the Finance Guy made it such a breeze!  I would definitely buy from Smith Volvo Again.  No pressure, really great experience and the price was great.

Helpful staff and great pricing. I love my V90 cross country. The car I carry my family with.

I bought my Volvo elsewhere but Smith is where I go for service. They've always been courteous, knowledgeable, and quick. Someone always calls the next day to make sure I'm happy with the service and to answer any questions, a nice touch.

The service manager, David, was very professional. My car was fixed quickly and the job was done well.

I have bought three cars from the team at Smiths. I have found them to be extremely honest in their dealings and fair price on their cars. The sales force is very knowledgeable and willing to go the extra mile to help the customer.

Sunset Honda
I had a very relaxed car buying experience here. You know, as mellow as purchasing something for thousands of dollars can be. No mini heart attacks were going on. I didn't feel like I was trying to be shoved into a car, or payment, that I didn't want. No one chased me around the lot. I went there looking for a specific type of vehicle, and I walked out with the exact one I wanted. I worked with Jeff Karsh, he is very laid back, and kind. I highly recommend working with him, the next time you're looking to purchase a vehicle.

From start to finish, everyone involved in my experience was very friendly and explained everything in terms of what was in my best interest. I took my car in on Tuesday for emergency service, and found out later that day the problem was with my engine, which had a hole in it. The service to temporarily repair the damage alone was more than the cars worth, and at 225k miles, it was not worth putting in a new engine. I walked through the whole lot with our salesman, Gil, and we found a great car that exactly fit my budget and needs. It had just been traded in and hadn‚Äôt even been fully processed. I‚Äôm a full time student and on my own financially, so it was huge that they were able to find something for me, especially something in my budget that I‚Äôm so happy with. They‚Äôve even given me a rental car for the next day or two while they finish detailing the car and double checking everything. I highly recommend Sunset Honda!

We bought a car from them, so I can't speak that bad of them, but getting through negotiations and paperwork took over 4 hours. They made sure we were comfortable, and were polite, and we did leave "feeling" like we got a deal, but so many hours. 

We bought a car in Santa Maria and it took half the time. Again, we bought a car, so we aren't mad at them, just thought it took a little too long.

Their after care has been awesome though!

Wonderful help from Mercedes! She is the best person I‚Äôve experienced working with when buying a vehicle. I recommend anyone who doesn‚Äôt have the richest credit talk to her, she can help!!! I bought 2 vehicles thru Mercedes in a 1 1/2 yr span! She is that good at helping out. I LOVE my truck and civic!!! Sunset Honda is the best Honda Dealership, that‚Äôs for sure!!

I have been happy with my Honda Minivan, but what really makes driving my Honda a joy is the Service Center that maintains it. The check-in staff are very efficient and knowledgeable. They know the cars so well, they sometimes use tricks to fix problems themselves. They help me prioritize repairs and stay relatively safe.

Simply Skin By Mary
I HIGHLY recommend Simply Skin, by Mary.

I have been a regular client of Mary's for about 12 years, and I have been very satisfied with the services I receive. I also find her rates to be reasonable, which is important to me, because I live on a fixed income, and must keep my spending within budget.

Nautical Bean
Amazing coffee!  Wonderful atmosphere.  Great outdoor seating.  Really cool scene with vintage skateboards on the wall and other neat art.  Staff is super nice and the owner Brett is an admirable and rad dude!  Overall great experience!!!

My favorite coffee shop ever. It has its really busy times but the line moves fast. Cool vibes and nice people. Of course, the coffee and coffee drinks are amazing, but the food is also fantastic. Love the garlic chicken flatbread and the breakfast burrito.

Nutty bean coffee is legendary.  Their salads and wraps are fresh, original and quite memorable. Patio seating is quaint. A great 2-4 people meeting place.

Fun little place! Tasty food in just-right portions. I'm not a coffee drinker but I might try some of their delicious-sounding drinks. Decor rocks.

This place is simply amazing. Great service, great coffee, great tea, great food, and the best breakfast burrito in town!

Cost Cutters
Best place in SLO to get a good, cheap hair cut. Great service

$13 on Tuesday.  What more can I say?

These folks are always very welcoming and professional. Discount rates available on Tuesday.

I have gotten my hair cut here 4 times by four different women and they all did an excellent job!

Haircuts vary from horrible to good. Bargain on Tuesdays. Usually no wait...but check your hair before you leave.

Shift Hair
I've been going to Annette for a year-and-a-half now and I just love her! She does a beautiful job. In addition, the staff at Shift is always very friendly and welcoming. Highly recommended. :) 

Tiffany is the bomb! All the other stylists rock as well! 

I randomly took a chance by going here......and boy was the risk worth it!  It is a charming space, with top of the line products and hair technology (they have amazingly advanced hair dryers that are non-damaging to your hair!).  I absolutely loved my stylist Lauren, and got the vibe that you could not go wrong with going to any of the stylist!  Overall, a fantastic salon.....I will surely be going back!

A few months ago, I had a horrible experience with a do it yourself dye kit.  I went in for an emergency hair treatment, basically I needed my old hair color stripped out and a new color dyed on.  They did an amazing job and made my hair look nice again.  I was so relieved.  I got my hair cut while I was there also, and it turned out great.  I would recommend them to anyone.

I have been going to Roberto for 10 years now.( I have long curly hair and use to be very hard to manage) My husband sees Mark for his hair care needs. The staff is Always friendly and Very professional. They carry top of the  line hair products and I would recommend ANYONE to visit this Salon.While getting your hair washed you get a massage from the chair,VERY COOL, the dryers are advanced and do not dry out your hair. =)

Rancho Grande Motors
Our 2016 Outback seemed to be having an electrical issue for the first time at about 35,000 miles.   Periodically would not start -- acting like the battery dead. We had to jump-start it three times just before we were to leave on a trip of about 2500 miles, in the Winter.  We took it into Rancho Grande Service Department to try to find out what the problem was.  They actually did not find the issue, but replaced the original battery (which still tested very well - actually above expectations), with a stronger battery.  

I actually believe the electrical issue is still with us, as evidenced by the fact, that about 200 miles into the trip, the electric clock on the instrument panel, froze at a given time.  At about 75 miles after the clock 
froze, we stopped for gas.  I turned the engine off, and as a test, started the car again.  No problem starting, and the clock was reset.  Re-booting worked, but if we have a situation as occurred when the problem mentioned in the first paragraph above occurred again, we would need to jump start it. 

However, whether the electrical issue is still with us or not, I believe the 
Service Department did what they could do, and that is appreciated.  I had a 2011 Outback, and they also did the service on that.  So far, I have found the Service Department has performed extremely well on both of our Outback vehicles.

Great service! Fair price! Really friendly crew! Shuttle to and from makes it easy. They also took care of a recall item I didn‚Äôt know about, all during the same visit.

We love our Subaru Crosstrek and we love Rancho Grande Motors.  The guys that check you in/out in the service department are super nice.  We recently had to have a small dent on the side of our car repaired.  While our car was in the repair shop (not Rancho Grande, another location) something strange happened and when we picked it up the check engine light was on, the cruise control wasn't working.  Rancho Grande was able to get us in with no appointment, checked out our car and got it working again.  What a relief.  We'll only take our car to Rancho Grande Motors.

Great experience shopping for my new Outback at Rancho Grande Motors.  They were very knowledgeable and quick with the process.  Each person that helped me was extremely helpful and accommodating.  I would highly recommend buying a car there!

I purchased a used Cadillac from another dealer which has needed a bit of work.  I've been very pleased with the work they have performed as well as the ease in finding the issues and correcting them.  Cory, the service writer is always friendly and knowledgeable. The courtesy rides are frequent and pleasant.

@ Nails
I liked the pedicure but they dont use gel, it's just regular nail polish, and the design that I wanted they couldnt do it either.

A great pedicure experience with most of the manicurists but occasionally get one who takes short cuts with less than good results

They‚Äôre very pushy and don‚Äôt listen to what you want. I‚Äôm typically an assertive person and they literally ignored me. I tried to show them a picture of the shape I wanted and the guy was like, ‚Äúyeah yeah I know what you want‚Äù and did NOT give me what I wanted and I insisted he look at the picture and he STILL didn‚Äôt do what I wanted. They do nails their way and of you don‚Äôt like that you might as well shove off because they do not care about what you want.

I arrived for my appointment to discover that no one was available to do my pedicure. After waiting 15 mins they had no idea when anyone would be free. A walk in customer was told an hour. I chose to not wait. 

This is the second time this has happened. I understand accommodating walk-ins but do not have an appointment option if you can't guarantee no wait.

Kevin was great at giving an amazing pedicure. It's a clean place and they offer free beverages as well. The only bummer was that the receptionist didn't speak English well. So, when my husband and I came for our appointments, he had to wait....she didn't understand that I made 2 appts for 2 people at 2:00.

Kreuzberg
Love Kreuzberg Cafe. Literally can't stop going back. Everything from when you walk in is enjoyable. The employees, the environment, the setting. Delicious selection of both drinks and food.

This is an amazing cafe, and really just soothing. It's a kind of hip/retro/alternative. The music is calming and the environment and the energy is just very peaceful and puts you in a sense of ease. The coffee here is amazing üíïüòç. The food is good, a little tip is don't get the broccoli soup üòÇ. The turkey pesto is a flavorful sandwich that I encourage you guys to try, I assure you it will not disappoint. Enjoy!!! üòò

This coffee shop is really cool and definitely had lasted longer than I thought it would. They roast the coffee on site And make the breakfast foods there as well. The coffee is well made and tastes great. The staff is hit or miss (thus the 4/5) and sometimes can be amazing and other times can be snobby, hipster kids. This is a great place to come to get a delicious cup of coffee or latte and sit and read a good book or study for a few hours. I would recommend it for it's atmosphere and ambiance if not for the staff. 

Good espresso drinks for sure. Good lunch food too. Great decor. Funny that it's called after a hip neighborhood in Berlin while Berlin is not such a great place for coffee.

Coffee is great and there's this one Barista that's a total cutie.  His name is Julian and he actually helped me find out what my favorite coffee drink is; a double shot Mocha.  Incredibly informative, friendly, and did I mention cute? ;) #whatahunk

Creating Harmony Women's Healthcare
I had all three of my babies delivered by the Midwives and they were all amazing. I had an emergency procedure done by Dr. K and he made me feel so safe and secure and I had never even met him before.  I do agree with the previous reviewer that the ladies who answer their phones are terrible.  They are the same ones that have been there for over a decade and never have they been pleasant to deal with.  But worth it to deal with them to get to the real gems.

Dr. Kromhout is absolutely, hands down, one of the most compassionate and knowledgeable doctors I have ever met.  He doesn't judge, he's gentle and he cares.  He's a blessing to all the women out there who are pregnant or not.  I can't say enough about  how magnificent Dr. Kromhout is . He's another hidden gem on the Central Coast.  His office staff is equally phenomenal.  This office is amazing!  I'm so happy to have been referred to him by a friend.

Doctor K is fantastic and honestly if I was rating him alone it wounder be a solid 5 without hesitation.  However, the ladies who answer the phone bring the practice down to a 3. Rating them alone would be a zero, but since I cannot do that they even it out to a three.

In the past I used a midwife and never thought I would have a doctor, but since we delivered twins we were forced to.  Wonderful doctor who walked hand in hand with us.  I ended up with mastitis after delivery and have called nearly every day for three weeks and the office staff would not get me seen or to someone I could talk to.  I eventually went elsewhere.  We are about to start another pregnancy journey and as much as I want Doctor K to be the one to walk with us again, the gals who book the appointments scare me and we will be going elsewhere.

I am three days post op hysterectomy and I have not felt better.  I have been dealing with pain in my pelvic area I think since the start of my menses. I had multiple cysts, endometriosis in the past and now fibroids.  Dr. Kromhout did say that fibroids were very small and probably were not the cause of my pain, but they could be pushing on a nerve.  I don't know what the issue was, but I did have leg pain, arm pain (I know call me crazy) and I no longer have this and I do have more energy just three days after my surgery.  Dr. Kromhout is not the only GYN that I have seen in the last year, however, Dr. Kromhout is the only one that gave me several options and treated me with care and like I was a person not a number.  For personal reasons I chose the hysterectomy and he not once made me feel like had made the wrong choice. Dr. Kromhout is what I call "my" magician.  He has made me feel like a whole new person.  He may have given me back my life without even knowing it.  I told him, "Maybe it is psychosomatic", but whatever it is, he did it and for that I thank him.  Dr. Kromhout you are truly magic.  

Thank you,

Mitzi Risenhoover

Dr. Kromhout is FANTASTIC! and so is his staff!

Jaffa Caf√©
I've been coming here for over a decade, including the old location, and it's always been fantastic. I do miss the wall of drinks they had at the old location, but it's easier to park at the new place so trade offs I guess. There food is always served quick and hot. Get their gyros, either the plate or the sandwich.

Really friendly staff and the food is great. Had the pita, gyro, and chicken shawarma and all of it was great. It is a perfect place to stop in for some fast Mediterranean food that is full of flavor.  Looking forward to going back.

I'm from out of town and wasn't familiar with the menu, the staff helped me out and I LOVED what I had! Great portion sizes and the garlic pita bread was INCREDIBLE! Highly recommend, very delicious!

Such yummy food. I highly recommend the lentil soup and hummus. Clean restaurant, friendly staff, and good service

Rock freaking solid. My whole family loves this place. Comfortable, good pricing, friendly staff, and great food. Don't change, Jaffa! My only complaint is that my man Adnan isn't around anymore.

Coast BMW
Tried to reach salesperson referred by my bank.  Left message with receptionist and called directly.  No response.  Saw a good value on their website but when at the dealership that vehicle was not available.  The salesperson assigned to me was not familiar with the BMW exterior colors or the interior leather groups.  After he talked to manager he found another vehicle I was interested in, but it as in a storage lot 15 minutes away.  I offered to go to the lot, drove the vehicle and wanted more info.  Salesman not familiar with lease or financing options. When manager presented me with options I could not compare to past shopping quotes as their location did not receive Verizon signal.  When manager presented buying options they seemed appropriate and was interested in leasing.  They were very pushy, wanting me to sign documents even though I had to go as guests were expected for diner and needed to leave.  My biggest mistake was to succumb to their pressure and allow credit card to be taken for deposit.  When I got home and consulted my online info I found they were more expensive.  I notified manager I would not go forth with lease and requested reversal of deposit.  After four days no credit has been issued and I have disputed the charge with my credit card company.

Avoid this dealer!  Horrible, horrible business ethics.  I never write reviews, but had to on this dealership.  I've been in the business and know all the tricks, these guys are a piece of work. I can rant on about all the misleading things they did, but this is it in a nutshell.  I was trying to buy a BMW i3 from out of state(willing to pay their asking price mind you with great credit), and went through 4 different people over the course of 4 days. Latter part of the 3rd day I thought I had finally gotten with someone to help me buy the car, they seemed nice, but all an act.  When I got numbers in an email from them, they were willing to sell the car, but tried to bump the price by $4,000 by adding a certification. I emailed back that I'd pay $2,500 more for the certification or just stick to the original price. After not calling me back on that 4th day, I called again just as I had to all the other times before.  He then told me because I was uncertain about my buying decision, they went ahead and sold the vehicle to someone else.  Hopefully you'll read this and heed to the warning, these guys are snakes!

It was my pleasure to experience buying an automobile from such professional hospitable family oriented business. Jose Macias and staff make you feel so at home and explain everything in detail. I would definitely recommend Coast BMW to anyone looking to have great car buying experience the easy way, no strings attached.

Alert Customers - Coast Nissan and Coast BMW are posting fake reviews as general manager Vince Troncoso is ordering them. He's a complete fake, he is drumming up a fake review campaign to drum out his business with fake 5-star reviews. He's paying a company to post them and he's giving the 5-star reviews fake feedback pretending to be happy on the customer he's replaying to. It's all fake people.

Dishonest from the GM (Vincent) down to the agent (Jose) that I dealt with. I felt like there was a lot of bait and switch tactic when it comes to purchasing a used car. The agent will tell you one thing and when you get to the written details, it does not match what was agreed verbally. They will try to pull a fast one if you're not careful. Don't do business with these guys. I'm going to consumer reports and present all the emails. I'm still owed part of the airfare for the aggravation that was never paid.

Boo Boo Records Inc
Great college town record store with a great history. You can get a little bit of everything there. T shirts, mugs, books, music of all kinds is on offer. They have a nice, not overly pretentious staff that know their stuff. Prices are fair for what you get. Support your local indie record store!

All the music!!!   Great selections of dvda and vynal.   Love the customer service the guys are great. And the best local place to buy concert tickets

They have a great selection of music from all genres and in all formats. Also, knowledgeable, friendly staff. One of the last great record stores.

There's a lot of over priced record stores in California, this isn't one of them. Great staff and competitive prices.

The guys at Booboos are the freaking best y'all... That's why they've been around so long... Thanks Frank & Jason.. .

Tigerlily Salon & Spa
My stylist was Caleb and he is AMAZING!!  I hadn't been to a salon in a long time so I was nervous.  My hair was down to my waist and I wanted a huge change.  He listened to everything I wanted and gave me great advice.   Caleb gave me a great style up to my shoulders and awesome color!  He really knows what he is doing.  My hair has never looked better and the price was perfect!  I will definitely be going back to him!

My sister's wedding was a couple weeks ago and we did our hair and makeup at Tiger Lily. We were very happy with our look and they incorporated a braid in everyones hair so we had the same theme. The salon is a great place to get ready. The lighting is great for photos and we are right downtown for coffee/ food.

Great place to get a men's cut. Trust me on this. I go to Heather because she really take time time to get it right. I always walk away  looking better and feeling better

Very well managed salon. All professionals meet a high quality standard. It's a great place. 

Ashley was amazing! I came in with a messed up short haircut with no shape and she turned it into an adorable wavy bob.  She even gave me hair care tips, not only for my own hairstyle, but also for my sister's hair after I mentioned her hair care techniques.  The place is really clean and well decorated.  I would definitely return!

Flanders Bicycle
These guys were great. I like to support the smaller local businesses. I went in to get my 2009 Gary Fisher serviced. I'm very happy with the work, and the price was great for all the work that was done. I will definitely be back.

Great shop.  Every time I go in there someone is up to the counter from the back asap.  Friendly staff and fast turnaround on repairs.  Seems like very little markup on the maintenance type parts I always go in there for, and great prices if I need a repair.  

Overall just a nice down to earth place without the usual sales pitch.  They deserve the solid rep they're building.

Incredible, I live 81 miles away and I won't go anywhere else now. I bought a used bike from a private party, just wanted a quick inspection before I made the trip back home, EVERY OTHER SHOP WITHIN 50 MILES, charged over 100 bucks and said I'd have to make an appointment.
I called Flanders, and right away they said come by, had the inspection done, needed a new chain and they installed it for me. ALL FOR 31 BUCKS!!! Also the crew there is just way chill to talk to, great atmosphere. I FRICKEN LOVE their business.

We recently purchased my son a bike here. We had never been to Flanders and it was our third stop looking for a bike. Everywhere else wanted us to buy a bike we weren't looking for, and we called Flanders before stopping - they had the bikes we wanted and when we got there they were friendly, great, and no pressure. They got the bike ready on the spot for us to roll right out with. The best service by far of any of the shops we visited. They definitely earned our regular business for bike needs in the future. 

I recently bought a bike here, and the staff were great with every step. When I first came in for some information, they were very friendly and informative, and at no point did I feel pressured to buy anything. When I finally came into buy my dream bike, I was able to also deck it out with accessories because of the 20% off accessories with the purchase of a new bike.  I highly recommend Flanders for any bicycle enthusiast, novice or pro!

Linnaea's Cafe
I fell in love with the cozy patio, then realized: this good feeling was not reciprocated! This is my 4th visit, and every time I order I wonder 'what just happened'. The other customers are very nice, but the staff is exceptionally unfriendly, unhelpful and have not once smiled. After 4 visits, this cannot be coincidence. I will not be back!!

Friendly staff, great coffee, and a variety of good food. They also have plenty of vegan baked goods.

The food and drink were great. Lots of gluten free options. But the indoor seating felt like I was in a library. About 10 other patrons were there for lunch, each on their own table with a drink working on their laptops. All dead quite. The patio out back would have been wonderful, but it was 109 degrees outside that day.

I love their coffee! the staff is very friendly and it's a perfect spot to study or just hang for hours!

One of my favorite, comfy hangouts! Absolutely.  Two issues take it down to 4 stars. The garden is fantastic until some chuckleheads decide it's a nice place for a conference call for work, or a bunch of coeds think they need to share their feelings with all the tables. And the lunch items are usually too organic, vegan froo-froo for me to eat there. Great light breakfast though!

Starbucks
A clean nice spot but an incredibly busy location. It took about 20 minutes to get the two coffees that we ordered.

Coffe is expensive....so are a lot of things everywhere else. Good service good coffee good people üëç

Usually my Starbucks visits are pleasant.  I'm thinking the staff here needs some additional training and coaching.  They seemed bored and  the coffee maker gentleman with dark hair seemed to busy on his phone texting.

This is my favorite coffee shop, I go there at night because the night crowd is very friendly. This particular coffee shop is one of our towns most popular hang outs at night, it is a very social place, even the town police socialize when they are in there. The atmosphere is laid back and full of smiles. I highly recommend this place, you will feel welcome.

my most favorite drinks at starbucks is there amazing hot chocolate always help me stay really warm on a cold day

Captain Nemo Games & Comics
My brother took us here while visiting SLO for a wedding. This store blew me away! It's huge and they have everything from comics and board games to vinyl records and and amps. Made some great movie and game purchases and found out they have a game room next door. It was locked but the staff gladly opened it for us to use for as long as we wanted. Am excited to visit again.

Great selection and customer service. I've been going in at least once a week for years and never had a bad experience. The staff learns who you are, and what you like, and does their best to help you out.

This place is huge. If your into music or comics then check it out. You won't be disappointed

Love this place. Prices are awesome on statues. Love the availability of products.
Pros: 
*well stocked
*great displays of items
*nice employees
*clean place
*hours they are open are awesome!
*Nicely organized for NEW comics

Cons:
*organization of comics upstairs needs better packin
*2nd section of comics are upstairs lol
*building temperature is always too hot?
*prices on older/precariously owned comics much higher than ebay
*parking first come first serve
*location is on a One Way, so if first time make sure to Google Map it, once you find it, it becomes super easy.

Awesome place love it. Thank you!

I love this place and I go about once a month to get my comics and if you want mtg cards and Pok√©mon, my favorite, you can get pre-made decks and booster packs for less than at stores. Great store will come again no doubt!

Dr. Cain's Comics and Games
Super helpful staff! Love the shirts in there too! Get kid sizes!

I drive 30 minutes every Wednesday to get my new comics here. Great selection, awesome staff, not just a big impersonal business. The staff makes good recommendations and treat customers fairly, friendly and professional.

Great local business that if they don't have what you want will get it for you... Oh and Dr. Cain is a kook and local treasure.

Awesome selection, cool people. Can't wait to go back!

Really lile this place over other comic shops in the area. Clean and not cluttered.

Beautiful Feet Books
We own many Beautiful Feet Books products and love them all! My children adore all of the books in the Early American History Elementary pack. As a parent and teacher, I appreciate the open-and-go nature of all of the study guides. We own History, Science and Character. Each study guide is laid out in such a way that I can open to a lesson I want to cover, see which books or pages we need to read, and complete the lesson without extensive preparation on my part. Each book we've used from Beautiful Feet Books is of high literary merit, moral integrity and teaches the material in personal, engaging ways. We will continue to use and purchase Beautiful Feet Books products!

I'm so excited to do the geography and character studies with my children this year. The character study guide is well laid out and gives such thought-provoking questions. I also love the fact that there are lots of extra suggested titles for us to explore. I also bought the D'Aulaire biography set...I've had my eye on those a long while!! This is gonna be a great year!

We are using the Early American History Primary Guide and books, along with the Teaching Character through literature and love EVERY bit of both studies!  Beautiful Feet Books produces quality materials and we as a family wholeheartedly recommend this company to those looking to provide their children with a feast of beautiful ideas.  The lessons are just deep enough, and yet simple enough to complete several each week for a range of children.  We use ours for our 1st grader, 3rd grader and 5th grader and it is appropriate for all levels.  We look forward to making Beautiful Feet Books a part of our homeschool for the years to come!

We've used several of the geography books, CA History oack, History of Science pack, and some d'ulaire books.  We've been pleased with it all.  Will definitely be buying more from here.

We have used several of their study guides now and they are wonderful!  We have LOVED the majority of the books, and they work perfectly as read-alouds for all the children together.

Coast Nissan
Yes the 5-star reviews on here are fake!

Horrible. Let's start with the dealership. They kept me in the sales office, alone, until almost 7pm on a work night after I told them I needed to leave. Advertised a car online that didn't exist, only to tell me they could get a similar one by ordering from Arizona. After a week, they call to say that car was already sold. Okay, so why did it take a week to find that out?! I bought from another dealership since this one obviously uses bait and switch tactics. They tried to sell me a car for $5000 more that was nothing like the model I wanted.

Now, onto service: for some reason, the airbag system is faulty in my vehicle. After *5 trips* and at least as many hours in their waiting room, I'm told that if the car continues to malfunction twice more, they would replace the entire electrical system (which, by the way, I said was the issue after the 3rd visit!)

Did they follow through? Nope. Two visits later and they use the loophole technique to claim that it was a "different airbag warning light" and thus, negated their promise. Six months later, with no solution in sight, I get a recall notice from Nissan for...you guessed it...the airbag system. I won't even go into have them fix it because it's a complete waste of time.

WORST experience over the phone ever!! Glad my husband did not drive from Santa Maria to San Luis Obispo for answers from Chet. Never will I ever want to deal with Coast Nissan nor any of it‚Äôs other linked dealerships. Management has A LOT to improve on. I recommend friendly and proper training on how to answer incoming phonecalls. How to greet individuals. How to maintain a positive attitude in the workplace. All this and much more. My husband and I no longer want anything to do with Coast Nissan. We hope these TRUE reviews with only ONE STAR help others for future references.

Worst customer service ever! It took my wife and me about six phone calls to get someone to answer the phone, only for them to hang up on us!! Afterwards we were finally able to get a young lady on the line which was kind enough to leave a messenge for Chet. Unfortunately till this day, he hasn‚Äôt returned our phone call. So much for him asking me to contact him to follow up on something. If I were going to get blown off like that, why even bother to ask me to follow up with you on a certain day and time? This location has to work on plenty of things. Beginning with management. I will not be willing to return to this place ever again. Let‚Äôs not forget all these random ‚Äúgoogle users‚Äù I believe those reviews are fake!! Five stars? Yeah! Five stars for being the worst!!!

I been a long time costumer for Nissan because I loved there services but this time they have really disappointed me big time.( I came to pick up my truck that I have bought here and had a check engine light after a week they didn‚Äôt fix it and the light is still there. And trying to talk to someone that actually listens it nearly impossible. Will is so unprofessional, my sales person told me to call her anytime I have a problem with the truck however, never answers. At this point I am so done playing the ‚Äú lemon game ‚Äú . Thanks ched I hope that‚Äôs how you spell his name but he is pretty cool.

Alert Customers - Coast Nissan and Coast BMW are posting fake reviews as general manager Vince Troncoso is ordering them.

Reveal salon
I called to discuss over the phone with the stylist and she kind of blew me off, saying whatever she thought I wanted to hear. When I went in she said it would cost more than double what I was quoted over the phone. I told her that I didn't want to pay double what we talked about over the phone she was so rude that she said I was wasting her time! I don't know how but she convinced me to do something else that I didn't really want and when it was all over I was in tears. She didn't care and wouldn't offer to fix. When I called to complain right after leaving the receptionist was rude and could care less. I will never return and do not recommend anyone go there!

I have been going here since it opened and I love it! The stylists are so friendly and always do a great job with my hair. I definitely recommend it to anyone!

I absolutely love Reveal Salon.  Not only is it a fabulous salon, but the stylists and assistants are extremely talented and wonderful.  Everyone has such a positive vibe.  Brook has been stylin' me up for the last 7 years, and I wouldn't change stylists for the world.  Im completely satisfied with my beautiful hair eveytime I visit.  Two Thumbs up, Five Stars, and all of the above!

I love the fact that Reveal Stylists are trained and educated in the latest cuts and techniques, and there's a really good atmosphere at Reveal too..

Heiland Auto Sales
Best place to go buy cars!!great prices!!! the workers are amazing and they don't try to con you they bend to meet you needs cars SUVS etc...my husband and I bought a 2010 ford edge for 3 years now and it haven't give us any problems at all  great spot stop in and ask for Blake Thumbs up.

Never will go back to this dealership. The guy never took me serious because I am younger, told him I had 2000$ to put down and still didn't treat me seriously. Got approved from my Bank for 6000$ Loan while he wasn't getting back to me on getting approved, so just went and got a nicer vehicle. LOT is OK, customer service is lazy and sucks.

Great customer service and helpful when it came to choosing the right vehicle.

I recently purchased a 2002 Excursion from Heiland Auto.  I had been searching for this very specific vehicle for weeks, and as soon as it came up on Craigslist I called and talked to Alex.  Alex was very helpful and respectful, and worked with me to get a very fair price.  Since I was an out of town buyer, Alex took the time to take additional pictures and was very up-front about the minor problems that the vehicle had.  I drove three and a half hours to get down to the dealership (from the bay area), and Alex stayed late on a Saturday to facilitate me.  The vehicle was exactly as described.  The deal was smooth and the car is great!  I would definitely buy from Heiland again.

These guys led me through every car buyer's worst nightmare.  I bought a 2003 Jetta from them, and 4 days off the lot, wouldn't you know it the check engine light came on.  I took it to get it checked out, and the cost to repair the car was more than half of what I paid for the whole car.

I contacted heiland, hoping that they would help me out.  I mean, the check engine light coming on after less than 30 miles is pretty shady, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and an opportunity to help me out.  They offered me roughly 1/8th the cost of the repair, and wouldn't let me return it.  Now, these guys talk nice on the phone and were nice to me in person, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm paying 1.5 times the value of the car just to drive it again (by the way, the issue was with the transmission, making it unsafe to drive).

I talked to 2 different mechanics, and I have it on record that if the car had been checked out, the issue would definitely have been found.  Heiland has repeatedly told me that they had the car checked out before they sold it.

What I infer from this situation is that Heiland had a car on their lot with a transmission problem.  I'm betting that because it still ran, they cleared the check engine light, and put it on their lot waiting for someone to buy it.  The check engine light usually takes a few days or weeks to come back on, but hey there's only a 3-day return policy.

This is fraud, plain and simple, and I plan to prove it in court.  I have my testimonies, and I'm in the process of taking this to small claims.  When this gets resolved, I'll update this, but the point of this review is:  Even though they talk and act nice, DON'T TRUST THEM.  If you like a car on their lot, always get it checked out by a trusted mechanic before you make the final purchase, or just go somewhere else.

Cambria Bicycle Outfitter
Great deals on anything you need for riding bikes! Very professional, friendly staff that have always gone out of their way to give me options and not just sell me on the highest priced thing. They know their customer and intuitively cater to their needs. I have always been satisfied with the level of customer service. Inventory is vast and if you need it, they probably have it- regardless of the year your bike was built. Visit the Paso Robles location for the best availability of items in stock as it is their warehouse and they most likely will have what you need there.

My sister is searching for a new, carbon, full suspension mountain bike. We went in to look at 5010's and the sales person we had was incredibly unhelpful. Not only did it seem like a burden for him to be working with us, he pointed us towards an Intense mountain bike that apparently is "identical" to the Santa Cruz 5010, yet couldn't elaborate on anything regarding either bike. In addition to him not being knowledgeable or articulate (we'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say maybe he's new), our sales person wasn't even excited... He wasn't excited about cycling as a whole or the $5,000+ we were willing to drop on a bike at his shop. We ended up leaving because it was not a positive experience and went to Art's Cyclery, which is top notch. My sister bought her last high end road bike from them and the sales people are genuinely excited about the product they sell and getting people riding... A pretty dramatic change from CBO.

Unfortunately, Arts doesn't do rentals, so we ended up back at CBO... Yikes. My sister took out the Julianna and I took out a Santa Cruz Hightower LT. The Hightower was spec'd with SRAM Eagle, which would've been phenomenal, except that bike felt like it had never been maintained in its life. The shifting barely worked, the braking squealed like there were tiny hamsters caught in the calipers, and the dropper seat post wouldn't actually drop. Its a pretty disappointing experience to pay $160 for two high end, incredibly cool bikes and to go ride only to find out that no one at CBO cares enough to service them. The only thing the sales person said when we bought the bikes back was "its a popular bike," which begs the question why maintaining it is so challenging...

Ultimately, CBO was a pretty disappointing experience in its entirety and there's no way we will buy any bikes from them. ¬†0/10 would not recommend.

Very pleased with my treatment and the price of the bike.  Looked on the Internet at some of the direct buy sources which would require my assembling the bike.  I feel I save a few bucks at Cambria and everything was ready to go.  Sales people are very helpful and do not work on commissions, so it's a real team approach.

I found they had a great price on a name brand rack and good deals on accessories. Online store was smooth and the shipping was fast and well packed. Would recommend!

Andrew was so helpful! He assisted me in choosing the bike, the size and finding my favorite color Orange! I ended up getting a Kona Kahuna - they didn't have it in stock so they special ordered it to me and had it to me as soon as they could. They also offer a free tune-up with the purchase. If you need a nice bike for a good price, this is your place!

First, the work they did is good.

Aside from that, the customer service leaves  lot to be desired. It stared when trying to make the appointment. The body shop and I played phone tag for one whole day until I decided to come in the following to avoid further delaying making an appointment. Jeff told me to come in Monday (it was Wednesday) and give them 5 days, that way it wouldn‚Äôt go into the weekend. 

Bring it in Monday, had not heard from him by Thursday so I called, 3 times, and the third time I waited until he just came to the phone. He admitted it would not be done Friday, maybe Monday. If I hadn‚Äôt called I would have never known. Don‚Äôt give a timeline if you cannot stick to it, and if you can‚Äôt stick to said timeline at least notify the guest about changes.

It is now Tuesday, I called this morning asking what the new eta was...

Unhappy about lack of communication from this company and department. Like I said, I‚Äôm sure the job was done will but not timely and the fact that I had to ask all the follow up questions leaves everything to be desired in the service department.

I would not use them again

Ive had a few car purchase experiences in my life, this is by far the worst. I will say that I will not call out anyone by name, that is not what this is about, I will call out the business.

The car was being leased, originally acquired from out of state, and they were contacted several times to attempt to purchase the car at the end of the term. No return call for 5-6 weeks, and the car went over the deadline. They waived the additional fee and allowed the car to be purchased (Although they said they normally dont resale leased vehicles). I was annoyed, but grateful that they allowed the purchase. Then the real struggle began.

The car was dropped off for inspection and detailing before purchase. 2 days later I went in to finish the paperwork, and pick up the car as I was told it was in "Perfect" condition. The detail/cleaning of the car still wasnt complete. Also they asked that I bring the car back in 2 days later to have the tires replaced, as rotating them wasnt good enough. They would fix the chip in the windshield then and finish the detailing. Said it would take a couple of hours, by noon at the latest. No problem.

I brought the car back the night before, the service department had no idea there was an appointment at all the next day, as it wasnt scheduled. They proceeded to schedule it on the spot and said they would take care of it first thing in the morning. Even had me park it in front of the door to make sure. Again annoyed, but not too bad. 

Noon the following day arrived and no call. I tried reaching out on the text "app" that was sent to me, no response. Tried calling the service desk, no return call. Talked to the individual i spoke with who financed my car, said he would reach out. I eventually got a call the following day informing me that my windshield would need to be replaced, that they couldnt fix the chip. I was confused but said ok.

The day after that I was told that the rear seatbelt wasnt working properly and would need to order that.

The next day I got a call saying the tires had never been ordered, and would have to wait on those. Ok? I thought an inspection of the car had been done? Why is a mandatory safety item overlooked, and is somehow caught when you are supposed to be replacing tires that you didnt order and a windshield that you werent?

During this time 6 different people were passing information between myself and the other person on the loan. All with mixing stories, half answers, and "I'll have to get back to you's", but never actually getting back to me.... someone else would with further confusing information.

At the end of it all, the car was picked up, the detailing/cleaning had NOT been finished. The windshield had NOT been replaced and I was there staring at the same chip I had left the car with. Also, the tires they had replaced... low air pressure. The gas tank? Less than 1/2 gallon of gas in the car. The kicker? After filling the gas tank and tires that were left low, and starting the car what did I notice? The "Inspection Due Now" notification pops up on the display. I couldnt help but laugh. 

So after having bought a car and waiting 12 days without it, Im not even sure what was actually done, besides waste my time. I was given the excuse there is a lot of problems in the service department, too many chiefs wearing too many hats. Well Im sorry, that is not my issue. Im paying for something, expecting a certain quality of service, get your act together for crying out loud.

When I asked to speak to a service manager, I was told he would be calling me the following Monday. This review is made the Wednesday of the week I was supposed to have gotten a call. Did I get a call? If you guessed of course not, you are correct. I will be filing a complaint to VWoA. I will file a complaint to Perry. I will tell everyone I can, in any way I can the poor service that occurs there. 

This was my first and last experience with Perry Volkswagen of San Luis Obispo.

Great experience shopping here!Drove up from Ventura to trade in my 13 tdi for a 15 tdi. Awesome experience all the staff was super friendly and really fast. Definately worth the drive 123 mile drive from Ventura. Will be servicing up here as well. Highly recommend,Thanks again.

Certified Auto Repair
One of the best customer service experiences I've ever had!

Max is the man, I've never met someone so friendly and accommodating. Dude seriously deserves a raise! He was always in a great mood and fixed my car as fast as possible while also doing really quality work. He gave me the best prices he possibly could and talked to me about all the work he did on the car. 

Thank you so much Max! I'll definitely be returning in the future.

Great experience! Super helpful and nice! Had the worst morning but certified (Max and Tj) turned it around!

Always a good experience here.  Fair prices,  good workmanship, knowledgeable and honest.  Have taken several vehicles here regularly over the years and never had a bad experience. Usually pretty fast too.

I rented a car in San Jose and drove to San Luis to visit my college student son (we live out of state). The car had a warning light come on. I called rental agency and they said to take it 30 miles up the road to their nearest location. Instead, I stopped by Certified and they plugged in their computer and read the code. Turned out to be ignorable for the duration of my rental. They didn't charge me! My son now uses this shop for his car. They do good work every time. Great place, great people.

I have taken my car here for years and I consistently get friendly and timely service. They don't give you 'the runaround' , the quotes are always fair PLUS they give a student discount.  These guys are exceptional.

Cole Mazda
Good service, great parts department, tried a little too hard to upsell certain services.

My wife and I had just turned in our VW across town for the buyback program and we stopped here on a whim to check out Mazdas. Honestly we didn't expect to like the cars as much as we did considering we had been expecting to probably buy a Volvo or Lincoln. It's a day that's been raining and we didn't particularly want to dirty up the cars on test drives but they said let's go. Took a look at 3 different models and ended up really liking two, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and how well they drove. We had been working with Joel and told him we were going to go grab lunch to talk and that's we'd be back either way. While at lunch we decided let's just get one and checked the website for other colors. Got back to the dealership and told Joel what we were thinking. He went and pulled the car up and we decided to get it. The buying process was quick easy and painless. It was great to agree on a price almost immediately and get the paperwork going. We had a great experience and have recommended a friend in the same VW buyback situation to check them out.

Service department was very friendly and quick, shuttle services are cool. Tony is my service advisor , very cool guy. Coming back soon.

Enterprise Rent-A-Car
I like the "we will pick you up" of this company.  It very convenient.  The car was available quickly, it was the size I could handle.  I felt that the company could do a better job of hiring more people at their locations so if one has questions, they aren't intruding on other customers and the staff would be more readily available.  Outside of that, Enterprise is easy to use and the staff are helpful.

San Luis Obispo, CA, Enterprise Rental Car, the staff were so accommodating and helpful. I had to drop off my truck at the dealership for repair and needed to get home to orange county. Enterprise came to the rescue. All I needed was a small car to get me home, but they only had a large truck. The representative (Steve, I think) said it would be no problem to give me the truck at the economy car price. Also, not knowing when my truck would be completely repaired, he offered a one way option so I could return the trick at my local Orange County Enterprise. Way to go ENTERPRISE! Thank you!

GREAT TO DO BUSINESS WITH ENTERPRISE RENT-A-CAR. ALWAYS PLEASANT AND PROFESSIONAL. MEET MY NEEDS EVERY TIME. THE ONLY CAR RENTAL BUSINESS I CHOOSE TO USE AND I THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY LIFE EASIER WITH YOUR CONSIDERATION FOR ME IN MAKING ME FEEL LIKE A VALUED CUSTOMER.

Enterprise is usually 50/50, meaning there's about a 50% chance you won't get the car you want, or there'll be some disastrous quality about the experience, unfortunately I fell on the short end of the stick this time, last time I'll be coming to this branch.

I've used their services several times and am pleased to review that this experience  exceeded my expectations-fast, courteous, and a mm exceptionally clean and luxurious rental! Thanks, Enterprise Los Osos Valley Rd, SLO location for the smooth transition to and from the rental and your professionalism!

I worked with Brandi and Cash. They were both very helpful and friendly. My reservation went smoothly. This is a small office so it is easy to pass by when looking for it. I will rent from this location again next time I am in town.

Courteous and straight to the point! Would definitely go there again. Brandi was super helpful and easy to talk to.

Outstanding service and clean cars. Andrea and Cash were very professional and helpful. We highly recommend this business.

-Mr. & Mrs. Bolega

Enterprise on Broad Street were very nice to work with, they had my car in minutes, cleaned and ready to go.  Mine was a one way rental, but they happily gave me a free upgrade to a bigger size and generally treated me quite well. This is the seventh year in a row I have used their one way service in the summer, and this was the best experience so far.  They have definitely made improvements, it is up to them to keep the quality high now.

Andrea was so helpful and accommodating to my needs since I was going though my insurance and the repair shop.  I would highly recommend her to everyone and would totally rent from her again.  Thanks Andrea!!!

Avis Car Rental
can't get them to answer the phone, and needed to talk directly to that office.  sent to central reservations where, as much as I appreciate bilingual help, I could barely understand the English of the three different reps.  Won't ever use them again

Picking up/dropping off from this location is always a breeze.  I've had to switch cars a couple times or had to get help over the  phone and the customer service is great; very friendly.  I prefer this location if I don't actually have a need to go to the airport.

Picking up a car at the Embassy Suites was easy and super quick. So much better than picking up at an airport location.

The Avis car service on site was part of the reason we decided to stay at the Embassy Suites and we are glad that we did! We saved a lot of money on the rental since they did not have to charge costly airport taxes etc...

If you have a choice, it is always less expensive to rent off-site than at an airport location. I know that sometimes it is not practical but in this case, it worked nicely for our schedule and needs.

Easy to rent, easy to turn in and no wasted time waiting in lines or walking 10 miles to get the car. It was right outside the door.of the hotel.

The only hassle was trying to get bluetooth hooked up - there seemed to be a glitch and the rental agent was helpful and had a great attitude.

Thanks Avis!

Avis counter is a small office in the hotel floor and there are some designated Avis spots on the north side of the hotel. The service is good and pretty quick. Biggest plus is that using this location avoids the airport fees!

Always am greeted with a smile and the people at Avis are always very eager to go that extra mile and help me out with fast and friendly service. Avis staff is jut OUTSTANDING. Cheers, James

Thank you SLO Auto Glass and Tint! Very clean office and the service was fantastic. For future auto glass repairs we will definitely use them! Highly recommend! Jermone was so helpful and really easy to work with!

Always a pleasure working with SLO Auto Glass.  Jerome provides excellent customer service.

Friendly staff and a flawless and quick installation. The whole process was easy from the first call to walking out the door. Their team is great!

I had my brand new 2017 Ford C-Max tinted with LLumar CTX in back and Air 80 in front and it turned out great!  Friendly service, a good fair price I didn't feel the need to shop around, and truly professional results made for a great experience.  Thanks guys!  Love the look of my new car!  Highly recommend!

I had my Vanagon tinted by Doug at San Luis Customs. I checked all over the county and they had the best price plus the lifetime 3M guarantee. The job was done in about a half a day in spite of all the windows. Very pleased with the result and it has held up well.

Grace Central Coast | GraceSLO Campus
Come by any Saturday morning, and you'll see adults and kids from Grace Church at 7am, working to distribute food to members of the community (no questions asked) through their "God's Storehouse" ministry. Come back Sunday morning, and you'll see young children, teens, college students, singles, marrieds, parents, grandparents - together worshiping God at one of Grace Church's multi-generational church services. Great, eclectic music style and solid, relevant Bible teaching. Come back during the week, and you see the church touching every aspect of the community. My family and I have attended for 7 years. Highly recommend.

I'm new to the church, but they have been exceedingly warm and welcoming. The people are very sincere. It's rare to find people trying to add to the community rather than simply take or benefit from it.  I hope to get more involved and I'm thankful for a place like this in the neighborhood. 

Beautiful church and great food bank Saturdays. Get there by 8am!

This church is just great! I've been to mountain brook and it is good, but your church is much better. The music is great too! Thank you so much!!!

My wife and I have been attending Grace Central Coast since soon after we moved to the central coast in June '15.  Some of the things that attracted us to the church are the biblically sound teaching, the boldness to talk about current issues and how they relate to the truth found in the Bible, the focus on connecting and growing in small groups, the broad range of ages and life stages represented in the church, and the seemingly solid children's ministry for our two little girls.

The thing that has kept us going back to Grace is the relationships we've built with other members through women's bible study, men's book study, and our small group.

The lead pastor, Tim, seems very genuine.  He quickly reached out to my wife and I soon after we had visited, learned our names, and encouraged us every time he saw us pass through the courtyard after service.  He constantly reaches out to new visitors and encourages the other members to do the same.  Helen is an incredible leader in the children's class room.

We are happy to call Grace our church home.

Sunset North Car Wash
New prices are a ripoff. I used to pay $7.99 for an exterior wash using a $3 coupon. I added $3 for the tip for a total of $10.99. Now its $12.99, no discount coupon for exterior wash, $3 tip makes it $15.99 or an increase of over 30%! Although they offer a reward system it is all on the computer and phone and I don't have a clue how to make it work for me. I'd give them 4 stars for the wash if prices weren't so high. I can't afford a weekly wash anymore and will try the Quiky Car Wash next time.

Best in SLO county.  I've been coming to this location for about 10 years now and not once have they disappointed.  They are always friendly and fast.  Frequently have some great deals like buy one get one wax free.  If you ever are in during their booklet sales I would recommend it.  They just did a full detail on my car and it looks new inside and out, great work.

Bought the big gold package for inside and outside including exterior wax and dressing.  Outside job was good.  Inside was terrible..Door panels still dirty, console still dust and holders dust full..floors not finished..not a good vacuum or interior wipe down for a big price.

Fast, friendly service. Affordably priced for the area.

This is a very nice car wash. The guys do a very thorough and good job and are very open to any level of car wash you desire. The speed is pretty good and I have done a deep detail two times here and it came out great. A pricing is reasonable and there is seating so you can wait for your car comfortably

Bath & Body Works
Love this place, especially around the holiday season. The staff seem to be super friendly and helpful. Every time we pass by the place, I am drawn in by the great smells.

Now that they have their own app that everyone can download and use to get rewards, makes more fun to shop here. Especially when they have they're seasonal things like, pumpkin spice, etc. Great deals too.

Super helpful and attentive staff. I needed help finding a new scent, as my old favorite had been discontinued, and I was treated like a VIP! The staff offered informed opinions based upon real knowledge of the store's wares. And, with very little input, helped me to choose a new favorite,  and which products in that line were best suited to my needs.

A pretty standard Bath and Body Works is perched on this corner and is always kept nice and clean. Can get quite crowded on Thursdays during farmers.

Helpful staff even with huge sale!

We just visited their Captain Morgan out front, but they were cool with the penguin sitting on it.  At least we assume from the serious faces and the store keeper quickly making his way to us.  Unfortunately we were in a hurry and had to be on our way before he could greet us...

Locals favorite.

The best liquor in the town. Friendly family. Great beer and liquor selection. Highly recommended

Great domestic and international selection. Helpful owner !

Last night I was stopping by Sandy's to pick up a 30 rack and this joke of an owner is flirting with these 2 underage, obviously intoxicated girls. He then tricked one of them into showing him her fake id to give his personal opinion on it.. thinking the guy was nice the girl gave it to him and then said he was going to call the cops on her! NO JOKE. It was the cruelest thing I've ever seen someone do. She wasn't even trying to purchase any alchol from him. Sandy is a joke of a person and all of the alcohol is SERIOUSLY overpriced. NEVER give this liquor store your business. The guys at campus bottle are way nicer or even cork n bottle. Sandy is a total douchebag though, I wouldn't even give him one star.

Wrona's Quality Auto Repair
Professional, friendly, and great service, I had head-gaskets and a clutch put in several months ago which have worked flawlessly ever since. Recently my car developed some squeeling from my alternator belt and they replaced free of charge! Overall great experience and I highly recommend to anyone needing work done on their vehicle.

These guys are pretty busy guys are always pretty busy but they do good work. I wasn't able to walk in and get an oil change on my day off which was a bummer, so I had to schedule it for a week out. I guess the fact that they are so busy is a good indicator of quality service. Thanks for getting me taken care of guys!

We take our fleet vehicles to Jim. They are honest, fast and always friendly. I highly recommend this shop to anyone needing a good quality mechanic.

These fellows are the best. They have integrity and do an excellent job.  They made sure my car was safe to drive my family around and went above and beyond.  I give them all my business.

They treated my mom really well when she brought her car to them. They actually drove on the highway with her so they could experience the intermittent issue that the car was having. They listened to her, which she really appreciated.

7-Eleven
This place is owned by a lunatic; will physically confront and attack you without warning. Avoid this place at all costs!

Just went in to there to get the free slurpee. Cashier acted super bent about it and yanked the straw out of my hand because it wasn't the right kind. (It was a green one instead of a red one...) Super rude, won't be returning. 

No free slurpy on 7/11. Guess they didn't get the memo.

Bad service 

We used tO go to this 711 all the time. That is, until the man in the checkered hat began to judge me on my purchases. I go to UCSB and only visit San Luis on weekends tO see my boyfriend, yet he still insisted that I drink too much wine and "it is not good". I told him I would make my purchases elsewhere since it bothered him. Jerk!!

Let's Party halloween
Shopped for a 3rd old's bday party and we found everything we needed.  The owners were extremely helpful and the party was a huge hit, the balloon section was great!

I o ordered some balloons for my daughter's birthday party that day early. As I came to pick them up I was sharing with the employee that they were for the next day she looked at me and said that these would not hold up for that long so she asked if I had a little more time and she made it the same bouquets of balloons with the high float so I would have nice balloons at the party . I appreciated that she took the time to tell me that and didn't leave me hanging.
It was my fault but they made it their problem

Every random thing I have ever needed they had it! I wish their hours were better but when I do get inside it's just a great little family run business full of every single thing you could ever want!

Great local costume shop. They have everything you can think of.

Had lots of good stuff! Very crowded

Avis Car Rental
Sam Is the best I love Avis he works with you Very professional,always remembers you . Getting a car from the airport is so easy. Glad he works there if not I would go somewhere else. I have been picking up cars From Sam for over 8 years. Give that man a raise.

This is THE WORST car rental agency at this location for professional travelers. I arrived on 25 Aug at 4:30. I was the first and only person in line after my flight. The rental agent took five minutes to check me in and said she just needed to go clean the car. I saw another customer approach after I left and I assumed that I wouldn't have to wait, but I did. Ten minutes after the customer behind me left the counter, the agent comes strolling out while texting on her cell phone, despite the fact she knew I was late for a client meeting. Then, fifteen minutes later, she pulls up in the car. I drive away irritated, but when I'm in the middle of rush hour traffic, she calls me to tell me she gave me the wrong key. She says she'll send someone out to meet me and to call back when I reach my location. Long story short, the car ends up turning off and I'm stranded until 10pm. She never answered the phone call when I called again 10x. Then, I called road service and they were shocked and said she never called or returned their calls. Then I found rotten food in the car. DONT RENT HERE. DONT.

We flew in privately to San Luis Obispo airport. We were pressed for time so Avis had the car waiting for us on the aircraft ramp. Just jump in and go. Likewise on the return. Could not be an easier or a more seamless experience. The car was perfect as well. It is not possible to have a better experience that this. Thank you, Avis! 

As usual, renting from Avis was a fast and efficient experience.  The college age attendant provided the paperwork quickly and efficiently and, following the computerized directions, provided me with a very comfortable upgrade.  I have only one complaint...a common one for cars rented from smaller Avis facilities that don't have their own car-wash facilities...the inside of the windshield had not been cleaned for a very long time.  This became a safety concern later in the day when I had to deal with a late afternoon sun.  Dirty windshields become somewhat opaque in bright son and dealing with that distraction on a hilly and curvy 2 lane highway left me with cramps in my hands from grasping the steering wheel.

My last minute rental was  great.  I needed a van to do some moving of family and was able to arrange it quickly and reasonable priced.

Rite Aid
Very friendly and helpful pharmacy staff. Large clean store with good selection.

Large selection of inexpensive beauty items - as long as you are of a lighter skin-tone. Nothing really for the well tanned or darker. And trust me, I've looked...

Well round 2 of this place, I got a lecture from the pharmacist because I posted a bad review and emailed corporate about my experience.  The only reason I went back there is because corporate asked me to.  They wanted to see how I was treated, and well the pharmacy manager decided to be little me and talk down to me an even quoted my first review.  Don't go here to shop, save the drama for jr high.  Well corporate will be hearing about this... again...

Tried to buy extra strength nyquill. They wouldn't sell it to me because I'm not 21. Put it back and tried to buy regular strength. Still wouldn't sell it to me. I'm 20 with valid ID avaiable. Very frustrating. I then went to the Rite Aid on Foothill and purchased it right away. I will not go to this store again as this whole ordeal took almost a hour.

Worst Pharmacy in town. If you want people to treat you porly and not care about your health go to these guys. they will treat you badly and then make it be your fault for them treating you badly

The "Target Tech" guy was beyond incompetent. What should have taken 20 minutes wound up taking over an hour. Not only did he expect us to sign the Verizon user agreement without viewing it, but he would never confirm our plan or the total monthly price. I'll be shocked if we ever get our $300 bill credit. When we logged into Verizon's portal we discovered that he had even signed us up for the wrong plan. What a nightmare to fix it. Don't get me started on this guy's lack of customer service skills. "One good thing about the temporary staff being gone, they can't steal anything anymore" That's not a professional thing to say, out of the blue, to a customer.

Purchased an item online that showed only 1 in the store. They pulled the item, messaged me it was ready within an hour. I picked it up the same morning. Start to finish, under 2 hours. (20 minutes drive time each way.)

Nice, clean store. Friendly people. I would probably shop there more if it were closer primarily for the grocery options as they seem to have some good deals. The red color scheme is hard on my eyes though and I can't stay long. The whole restroom/changing room policy thing awhile back was a big turn off too.

Had to seek out 3 associates to find an item, one person didn't actually work for Target (vendor?), The next guy put this head down when he saw me coming then suggested I try using the target app to find something, the last person at least indicated the item was on a clearance shelf (but not sure where). Not a single person offered to help me. Days of "can I help you find something?",  Target's mantra, are no more.  The cashier never made eye contact with me and never asked if I was able to find what I was looking for. Just terrible customer service all around, I was very disappointed.

Plenty of cashiers. Super nice store. This has to be one of the biggest Target stores on Earth

Men's Wearhouse
I had a bad experience at this store, I've bought suits before at other MW stores and had great customer service from them however, this store needs to get better salespeople. One specific salesman kept staring as giving us bad looks at me and my friends like if we were going to steal something, he was murmuring something to another salesperson about us and both kept giving us bad looks so we just left the store. This store really needs to step up their game with their sales personnel. I'm not going to buy from someone who looks at me like if I were some kind of thief, I'm taking my business elsewhere.

I am giving 2 stars because only the manager and one of the sales person (nameless) are horrible at their jobs.
I was looking for a white casual dress shirt, and the salesmen recommended me a $100 shirt, bit expensive for a casual shirt, maybe for a dress shirt but dam.. Expensive. (reasons I find out later why), he told me it was my SIZE, slim fit, and stretch collar. 
I read the tag and it does say it is a slim fit, stretch collar. 
Later, I try on the shirt and find out it is to big for me! Even when you tuck in the shirt I looked like a deflated balloon! Big in the chest's, arms, and waist also.
So I go back, same day, to return it.
The manager says "since it is worn, even ONCE, they don't do returns." How would you know the clothes fit you without wearing it once is my question?! All different brands have different styles and for the amount of money you pay, you should get the style you feel most comfortable in.
The manager went on to say that I also had the shirt steamed, which never happened (probably the salesmen lying to him), told me he would never sell a shirt, even if worn once in his store... Really?! I find that hard to believe.
Which pissed me off most! When I asked if they can tailor it to fit me! He told me it would take a week, and I had to wait for someone to tailor it, which I waited... Until I found out he started suiting another customer while I was waiting.

As a perfect fit member, probably one of my worst experiences at a MW.

They need a real tailor and sales people that know what they are talking about.

Chelsey L. helped us pick out tux rentals for our wedding.  She was so knowledgeable and extra helpful! She also had great tips to share. We really enjoyed our service and will definitely be going back thank you Chelsey!!

They are one of the only stores for men's clothing in town with a consistent stock of sizes.  Staff are very helpful.  The challenge is their extremely poor tailoring.  My husband had to retailor every suit purchased within the last year as they were so poorly done.  They should know better and as a wife I shouldn't have to micro-manage the tailoring when my husband did his final fitting.  The pants were unwearable and the tailor should have redone them.

Ross Dress for Less
It's a messy, busy, store, but I always find great deals in there. Women's shoes, home decor, kitchen and bath linen, and sometimes very inexpensive craft items.

Decent place. Usually low stock of product. I'm sure it's due to heavy traffic with the university near by.

I can't say the depressingly sterile lighting of ROSS is my kind of aesthetic, but for the bargain-hunting crowd in SLO, this store is an absolute trove of good deals. Great hand-me-downs with style and a low price is a standard here

Friendly staff. It's Ross, great prices on clothes, some children's toys, home accessories, jewelry etc. Daily shipments so inventory changes frequently.

Great products for great prices, if a bit haphazardly organized.  A big and tall section would be useful.  More signs could help, as I almost didn't notice the downstairs area of the store.  They were also out of stock of a lot of things, a lot of empty shelf space, but maybe they had a really good Friday.

San Luis Auto Repair & SMOG
Wow, super convenient and excellent customer service from the entire staff! Called for a last-minute smog test and was able to get in/out in less than 30 minutes as promised. Very friendly and professional all around. Nick the owner is super nice. Support local businesses like this one!

Out of town with a brake issue and 2000 miles away from home. I was fortunate I saw the billboard on the highway and came to these guys first. 

They worked hard to get my repair cost down low and the repair done the same day and they didn't even bat an eye at my front receiver making oil filter access otherwise tricky.

Good honest shop.

Great smog shop and wonderful staff! After noticing an improperly routed vacuum line on my engine during a visual inspection, they directed me across the street to Napa autoparts and told me what I needed in order to correct the line and pass smog. They waited for me to return with the part and corrected the issue before finishing the smog test. Rather than failing me, telling to fix it, and then making me pay for a retest, they went out of their way to assist me. When I inquired how much I owed for labor, I was told not to worry about it. Shocked I insisted on at least tipping the mechanic for his help and advice, however he refused to accept my tip. This is an honest shop with amazing customer service and fair prices.

Excellent workmanship and service..honesty and integrity

I‚Äôve had my cars smogged here for a few years now. 

They are always Kind & Professional, and the Shop is always nice and clean.

Mercy Church
I came here by myself a few months ago. Everyone here is SUPER nice and inviting. It's a bit overwhelming at first because you meet so many people so fast, its awesome! Come as you are. :)

Has changed my life, love this church.

True Christ centered worship. Solid bible based teaching. Full of cheerful smiling faces on Sunday and plenty of ministries to get involved with. Go here, It's awesome! 

This church is so great! It has truly changed my life.  The first time I went, I was welcomed by the most genuine and loving people.  I met people who are serious about their faith and I was constantly encouraged to really live my life for Jesus.  I highly recommend this church to anyone looking for a family.

INSPIRIATIONAL !

The Sock Drawer
As a self-made sock connoisseur, I find their selection to be incredibly immense, but I don't think they really execute any single sock design well. Their prices are very reasonable, and the store is a great choice for a fun visit in SLO

Fantastic socks! All styles, for men, women and children. Crew and knee-high socks, dress socks or just for fun socks. A novelty sock store. A fun place to visit. Serious athletes should go to a sports store.

My mom loved the frida kahlo socks I bought her 

What's NOT to love about this place?? Git your socks on!

A fun, quirky but slightly pricey store for the sock enthusiast!

San Luis Autobody
San Luis auto body knocked it out of the park. Quick turn around. And handled my insurance. I wish the rest of my car looked as fresh as my front bumper now! 

Paul was great. And the front desk (sorry I don't remember her name) was very friendly. 

Hopefully I'll never need to come back. But if I do...

Service was amazing. Very friendly people and got me in early. They did not over charge me and they did excellent work on fixing my bumper on my car. I would come again. 

People working at San luis Autobody are very friendly.   They send me emails with pictures while my car was being  prepared, so I was able to track the reparing process.  They are also professional.  I highly recommend this place :) !

Wonderful service. They were very helpful explaining what needed to be done and took care of it as soon as they could. Good location that made it much easier to find! 

Professional, courteous, and great communication! They repaired my truck (ins. claim) after I wrecked on 101. Extensive front end damage. Pat kept me updated weekly with pics and they delivered on the date that was promised. Absolutely beautiful work! Keep it up you guys!

0/10.  My authentic ID was turned down because I recently got a haircut.  If your legitimate ID is turned down, inform staff that you are willing to wait for the police to verify your ID - I would have if I hadn't been in a hurry and that's what I'm going to do tomorrow if the same snarky guy is working there.   *I appreciate covering your own ass but if the snarky (yes, I repeat, snarky) guy had taken two seconds to really look, it would have been obvious that the picture is me.

Clean restrooms and new pumps.

CVS
The staff there are doing the best they can. Could they do better? Yes. Could they do a lot worse?yes
I‚Äôm glad the store is there.

Today is Dec. 1 2017 and I called at 11: 20 am.. So whoever answered the phone which was a rude lady this is why I'm not doing business there ever. The lady on the phone was so rude and all I was trying to do was ask if they had a medicine from a certain manufacturer because so many of the generics are not working. And she told me she couldn't tell me that over the phone, after I had just called 3 CVS pharmacies and they had no problem letting me know. So nope they just lost a promising customer. 
Thanks Rude B#?&@!!!!!

What a terrible experience. I called the pharmacy around 3:00 to try to get a prescription filled (an urgent one) from out of state. The man on the phone took all of my information (but was not very friendly). I called back around 5:00 to find out when it would be ready. The same man was on the phone and said "it probably won't be ready until the end of the evening". I asked when that was and he said "around 9:00- we are very busy". I explained to him that when I called earlier I told him it was urgent and he should have told me that then. He said "well you should have it filled somewhere else".  I never write reviews but felt compelled to write this one! Terrible.

This location is not in the best shape. It could really use some upkeep. It seems dirty. The last time I went in to grab some medicine, there was one children's Tylenol left and it was dusty.
The employees have been nice. There is a good selection of greeting cards.

Grungy and dirty, with uncaring, and unknowledgable staff.

Rizzoli's Automotive
I am 70 yrs old and took my son's car in because there was a leak.
I told R. and P. that it was my son's car and he had to approve all repairs. I asked for a written estimate five times. everyone ignored my requests and three days later they sent me a bill for $1834 with a list of $8,000 more in repairs. The car was 14 yrs old with 282,000 miles and we would have junked it before spending any money on it. When I disputed the bill they insisted I sign a release for any and all liability on the repairs made on the car.  I would not sign it or pay for the repairs.  They seized the car and I lost my only transportation and it has caused horrible stress. They do not provide written estimates . They will call and suggest repairs and bill you thousands of dollars without a written estimate.  DO NOT GO HERE.  They took advantage of a Senior with a junk car and billed thousands of dollars on a car with 282,000 miles just to make money.

Rizzoli's is just a great place to get your car worked on. They accept appointments and they stick to the time that they say my vehicle will be ready. There are never any surprise charges and their work is always top notch. They even wash your car after it is worked on. They also email reminders for any work that needs to be scheduled.

THIS PLACE IS AWESOME AND THEY PROVIDE GREAT SERVICE AND WONDERFUL  CUSTOMER SERVICE ON ANY CAR!

I was stranded on Route 101 South, AAA towed me to Rizzoli's. Within a short time Rizzoli's diagnosed a tire problem and sent me to a local tire store at no charge. The service manager at Rizzoli's named Brian was great to work with and provided the diagnosis that was right on the mark. As an out of towner, I am grateful for the service they provided. I would highly recommend Rizzoli's Automotive to anyone who needs work done on their car.

Very professional and friendly. They wash your car with your service. Excellent service can't recommend them more.

Newman Catholic Center
Great services & great community!  I love how the chapel was built and within the first few weeks there were so many students coming that it seemed too small to house them all.  Definitely a lifeline to many at Cal Poly.  

When I came to Cal Poly, I was a lost freshman who thought he was doing "okay", but God had different plans. This center, the pastors and staff who work here, and the friends I've made here have changed my life. I'm eternally indebted. Glad to call this place home.

Wagner's Import Services Center
Started taking your vehicles to Wagners a few years ago after recommendation from a friend. Have been thrilled with their service since day one. Reasonable pricing upfront and honest. Truly a place the cares about their reputation more than the dollar.

Good honest work and much more reasonable than the dealer. Chuck works on my wife's 2004 Honda Odyssey. The Ody has over 150K miles and still going strong with NO major repairs, thanks to his thorough maintenance work.

Chuck and Jay are two great guys who know what they are doing and always go out of their way to help. I take all of my vehicles there!

Good mechanics, fair pricing!

I recently had a back door actuator (CR-V) that needed replacing.  The local Honda Dealer wanted $165 for the part plus labor.  The total cost at Wagner's was much less the $165.  They did a great job, without any drama and the guys there are very friendly.  This shop also does other Japanese imports.  Support a local business!!

SEPHORA
My experience at Sephora at the San Luis obispo,ca location was terrible. The manager continued to follow me around the store until she called security who than took over for her. I felt very uncomfortable. I was unable to shop in peace as security stood over me & than proceeded to tell me I couldnt try on samples. I was looking for a gift for a friend & didn't purchase anything because of it.As the only Ethnic face in the building I felt very uncomfortable and won't be spending my money in the San Luis Obispo location ever.

Super friendly staff, felt very welcomed.
They helped me with everything that I needed and very knowledgeable. 
Will come back for sure!

Unfortunately I don't know who the Sephora thinks they are but they are so rude and you're not accommodating to their customers once you're a loyal customer. What I mean by this is if you're a familiar face they just feel like the brush you off and don't need to help you but if you're somebody who looks new to them they will bug you and go down every aisle and stalk you.

I recently went into the San Luis Obispo store for one item.  I stood in line where the sign said something like "Line forms here." Apparently I was in the wrong area for waiting because the cashier asked another customer to be next.  When I spoke up and said I had been waiting before her, the cashier just told me I was standing in the wrong place.  Both she AND the customer should have let me go ahead. Very rude of both of them. I will never go into that store again.  We have ULTA and MAC that arrived after Sephora. If I could have chosen zero stars I would have.

I go to Sephora almost every month and not once have I been treated disrespectfully. The staff always finds me exactly what I need and helps me figure out what would work best for my skin. Absolutely love this store and shop only here for my makeup and skincare needs!

Mat's Brake & Alignment
Brought my '96 Ford Ranger in for a brake inspection today, expecting that i would need new brake pads. They worked on my truck right away and suggested that my truck was pulling to the right and that they would try to fix it by aligning and rotating the tires.

The aligned and rotated the tires, and my truck ends up pulling left because of a "radial tire pull" (which is out of there hands - I'd need new tires to fix it). They were kind enough not to charge me for the tire rotation as a result. 

I had dropped my car off before work and my car was ready at about lunch time.

I appreciated their honesty in telling me that the brake fluid in my truck currently was still good, when they easily could have flushed it and charged me for it anyway.

The guys at the shop seemed like good, honest people who knew what they were doing. I recommend them.

Funride
So very disappointed in this business. Their website advertised that they had cars available in my city, so I went through the entire process of applying, getting approved, and putting in my billing information, only to find out that they had removed the cars in my area and just didn't bother to update the website. I inquired as to whether it would be possible to get a car back in my area given the situation and the demand for this service in this area, and they said they would get back to me. They did not, even after several attepmts at following up. What a shame.

Cheap. No extra fees based on your age. Hybrid cars with high gas mileage OR electric, so you may not even have to pay for gas! Imagine one of those other guys "upgrading" you into a freaking truck that gets like 1 mpg.

Their website is extremely easy to use and has a pretty good user interface.

Just get a key fob, reserve online, and walk right up to one of their cars in locations all over town.

Great customer service. The owner is extremely flexible and a good guy who's willing to help you.

There's nothing more you can ask for in a car rental service, and frankly put most car rental services barely reach the standards to MyFunRide.

DICK'S Sporting Goods
First time here and I loved it. Prices are so much more reasonable and alot more merchandise to choose from. Highly recommend to everyone who hasn't visited, it's a must...

Went there just one time. Plenty of options for many sports. Good products from several well-known brands.

Nice place. Average sporting goods store.

Not knowledgeable help with product information! Mostly Young college kids that don't know the difference between a catchers glove and a fly rod, don't waste your time going there if you want to find good fishing gear!!

It's a nice lay out and easy to find what you're looking for.

Calvary SLO Church
Calvary SLO was my home church in the late 90s,  in my late college years and young married life..
I'm so glad to know that Bryan is still preaching a Jesus centered  gospel, and helping to build a gospel community on the central coast. I can highly recommend Calvary SLO.   Also, Pastor Bryan makes an unusual but tasty lemonade, be sure to get some of that too!

Love this church. We started attending in January 2015 and quickly got plugged in by joining a community group. There are many opportunities to meet new people on Sundays or during the week if you join a small group. The pastors's sermons are biblically sound and the messages are relevant and Christ-centered. The worship style/band is contemporary, featuring many popular songs you'll recognize from the radio. Overall a great church whether you are exploring the Christian faith or have been a Christian for many years.

Home is the best word to describe our time here. From the first Sunday we stepped in we knew this was where we'd call our church home.

Biblical teaching, great pastors. Family friendly. Immediately felt like we were welcomed into the community

There are some wonderful people at Calvary!

Absolute Auto Tech - Car Repair
Great auto service. Very reliable and of the only places to take large trucks

Extremely friendly, excellent workmanship

Jason and the guys are above and beyond !

Over the years of going to Absolute Auto Tech I have grown to have nothing but the highest regard for their work and expertise. I trust in Absolute Auto Tech to be honest and to do the job right! We recently moved to Grover Beach, but it's worth it to me to drive the additional miles in order to have the peace of mind I get every time they work on our cars.

Very great shop. They are nice and friendly and do a complete job as well as recommending things that should be done to greatly extend the life of your vehicle. The owner Jason is a very nice guy and knows a lot about automotive topics. I've had great luck with them and highly recommend them.

San Luis Cemetery
If I could, I would never have buried my husband here. To begin, it was a decision made in an emergency‚Ä¶and because I did not use the same funeral home (owned by the same family) I was treated poorly. I was a widow in shock - bought two plots together. When I complained that the gravesite had not been "dressed up" properly - which means that the ground was just shoveled on top of the grave, not compacted or leveled - Mr S said that he was doing "his best" ( 2005)
When I placed the headstone, he objected, because I did not purchase it from him.
Later, I had to lay sod myself, because he would not plant grass. Farm Supply intervened and did the work, free of charge, out of respect for my late husband.
11 Yrs later - the sod has died, Mr S can't take care of things due to "drought", and I am considering disinterring my husband's remains and  moving him to a better place. This has been beyond upsetting. Horrible ownership. Do not consider this for your family.

There is a small pyramid of a tomb in the cemetery.

first time here and I will be back since it was nice staff and clean store jist restroom needs some attention.
the trash outside was even empty and waters full which is nice most time gas stations don't care anymore. 
thanks I will be back to this one

My boyfriend and I were verbally assaulted by an employee here. Later, trying to call a manager that we could talk to was made impossible by the fact that they never answered their phone. The employee had some obvious anger management issues and the small issue regarding a lost ID (my boyfriend's). My boyfriend had a separate purchase to make, and was not involved in my purchase of a pack of cigarettes. He stated that I could not purchase them, even though I am 7 years over the legal age limit, with my ID for evidence because we were in a "group". He then stated that my boyfriend was a vagrant, and that he was under arrest, raising his voice and tone, then seemingly ready to get physical, we made the quick decision to go elsewhere.

I am concerned with their choice of hiring, and have not yet made contact with a manager. I suggest going to ConservFuel, down the street towards town. They have the cheapest gas in town, and I've found that all of the employees are friendly, some even remembering my name. What a profound difference...

Amazing gas, never seen such flammable, clean burning, performance enhancing fuel.

nice people .

The gas here is, well, the same as the gas everywhere else. The prices are not ridiculously high, but aren't super low either.

The best thing about this filling station is the mini-mart. It is open 24 hours a day and is always clean and well stocked. There is always coffee available and usually hot dogs, in addition to all sorts of packaged foods and drinks. There are only a few 24 hour businesses in the area, and this mini mart is always my after-hours destination when I need a cup of coffee or a snickers bar.

Rite Aid
This is the greatest pharmacy ever. I watched the pharmacist deal with a wildly rude woman in the calmest and most courteous way I could imagine. Why people are so rude and entitled is beyond comprehension.

Why do we ever shop at Rite-Aid? Not sure. Overall a nice store, good location but the Ricola Cough drops I bought cost twice what they should have. I was there early Sunday so no line but Rite-Aid is famous for having two slow cashiers and ten people in line so I suspect this happens here too.

Every time I've had to get my prescription they never have it ready when they say they will. Super inconvenient and always ends up in multiple trips and a lot of wasted time. Super frustrating.

"been shorted more than once" HAHAHAH that makes me laugh!!!! You must not be able to count or take too many before you get home LOL!

This new location is really clean and fast filling prescriptions. They always print me off an unnecessarily long receipt.

Mountainbrook Church
This church is a complete disgrace.  People walk into the house of God stuffing their faces with donuts and coffee.   They don't even have the respect for the House of God to feed their yaps before church.  They think that the House of God is a time to watch Mr. Rogers.  The pastor is an even a bigger joke.  Had to take a three-month sabbatical.   Give a break.  This is pastor is a joke.  I come from Oceanside,  CA where Pastor Mike Reed is a true man of God.  Pastor Mike would the disrespect attitude towards Christ as the laughing stock of a church Mountainbeook Cburch.

After prayer we were led to start attending Mountainbrook in October of 2010.  Pastor Thom is 100% dedicated to the Lord's work and our whole family has grown spiritually.  He is a compassionate gifted teacher and his family are dedicated to service as well.  
He is NOT an egomaniac as an earlier poster had said, it is not easy to direct a large growing church and some hard decisions have had to be made over the last few years that included layoffs etc.  Thom began at MB making very little and has "stayed the course" to grow the ministry with his family.  
This church is making an impact for Jesus's kingdom both locally and internationally.  People are getting saved, baptized and spiritual growth is happening.  We are blessed to be involved in this ministry!        

Everyone is always helpful.

Hertz
This was the worst rental experience of my life.  Uncooperative staff, my concerns were not resolved.  Complete garbage customer service.  I will never rent from Hertz again, and you shouldn't either if you want to avoid headaches with your rental car.  Go National, they nail it every time.

I'm a Hertz gold club member.  They did not have a car ready when I arrived.  First car had inadequate air conditioning and steering was unstable at speed.  I had to drive all the way back to San Luis Obispo to swap the car out.  The next car I had for 2 weeks; they triple charged the fuel (on accident), charged a $200 detailing fee, and when I spoke to the manager, he agreed to correct the fuel issue, and said it would take 5-7 days to correct it and he wouldn't be able to get a corrected invoice until then.  The correction was not made, no updated invoice was provided, and I had to submit the expense report with 3 times the fuel cost.  Go to Avis when you fly into San Luis Obispo; this isn't even a real Hertz.

The most unprofessional ignorant business people I have ever met they'd ask me on different occasions to spend money out of my own pocket to fix their car they have made my life so complicated I hope that they go bankrupt and had terrible things happen to them both in their professional and personal life there is one lady that works there in particular I wish the worst worst things imaginable would happen to her on a constant basis and if it had your life would still be too good for her I don't use this word but she is a fu#@$ng c‚òÜnt.  do not rent from here once again do not rent from here they will lie to you on every chance they get and try to overcharge you for everything they are actually not even hertz their what is called a license. The morons that actually only business complained about me needing to have the car for a longer period than originally thought I was stranded when I blew my engine you needed a rental car for work and these people have no idea what they're talking about I honestly hope he breaks down to an extent that they lose everything they put into it that's how much I hate these people how ridiculous their business ethics are.

All they know is how to say no

Renter beware!! Turn your rental in to another hertz location.

Do not leave the counter until your rental car has been completely checked in by the teller. Three times in a row, they have failed to check in the car I have returned, rented those cars to someone else and then charged me for the next person's rental. This has resulted in over $500 dollars in over charge!

I have reported all three issues to Hertz Corporate (I had to, to get the hundreds of dollars back that I was over charged) and they seem uninterested in looking into the issue. 

Renter beware!! Turn your rental in to another hertz location.

Fast Eddies Car Wash
Time definitely runs fast with $5 =6mins. But the main guy was nice and reactivated the machine for an extra minute when I was literally 15 seconds from finishing the rinse and ran out of time. Getting change is a bit of a hassle as a card only can get it in 5 dollar increments.

Please, if you care about your car, do not use these facilities. First thing when I pull in, I notice there are a handful of screws and nails on the ground.  Seriously, at a place where cars are constantly coming in and out,that is a huge deal.

Secondly, the only good thing about this place,  they do have a direct credit card to coin machine, which is awesome (reason for two stars instead of one).

Lastly, this guy, I'm assuming Eddie, came out and scolded me for trying to use my own soap. I had already paid and gotten everything ready to start using the time I had paid for. He the proceeded to tell me how good his brushes are (even though they were very scratchy) so I left. I didn't want to ruin my paint and I feel like if someone has paid for time at your facility you should maybe be a little nicer and more considerate.

I cannot recommend this place to anyone except those who don't care about paint quality, as long as it's clean paint.

This place is a joke. I'm washing my car here and ran out of money and tried to walk across the street to pull out more money why leaving my soapy car there and he told me I needed to leave I wasn't aloud to leave my car and get more money to finish washing it. Also got rude with me because I used my own sponge and soap on my brand new car.

Was looking for a easy & quick car wash, this place is good. Spent close to $5 for a complete wash & you can only use the foam brush or the hose at a single time. 

Usually pretty clean. Not many options for cleaning products (rinse, pre-wash, foam brush and spot-free rinse(spot free is always empty...). They do tend to replace the brushes within a reasonable amount of time.

Lady was rude when I asked if she had more Iced Coffee 

Seemed adequate for 7-11! Convenient to my work location.

The mini fridge that dispenses cream and milk had mold and was splattered with old rotten milk underneath, where the spigots were. The door to fridge was open. Cashier didn't care at all. I took pics and wrote a long yelp review about it with pics.

Rented a movie from the redox here, great location

Called him he was very nice very fair on his prices for stereo and install got me in same day did a great job. I'd send my grandmother here.

Fantastic service! Friendly employees! Reasonable prices and upfront honesty! What more could you ask for?!

They do great work and it's nice because I like smaller places that know what they're doing and aren't overwhelmed with too much like bureaucracy, haha!

Quiky Car Wash
I like the car wash, it has a monthly membership, pay one price and wash your car as many times as needed through the month. They have one of best and powerful vacuum systems. Plenty of vacuum stalls.

Quick cheap and great service.  Free vacuum and a dash wipe.

Awesome Place quick and easy especially the free vacuum cleaning included

Great service, fast wash, clean machines. They have free vacuum use, with free wet towels.

You can buy a pass for unlimited washes for a month. Free vacuums. Never drive a dirty car.

Ambiance Clothing Boutique
The have the best collection with high-quality stuff. Great experience...

Horrible customer experience! I bought a great sweater at this store, I also saw a cute cardigan which was not available in my size, so I went online to check on it. And guess what, most of the things that are in the store are half price. Why in the world would I overpay $60-$100. A lot of stores that sell similar items at least do some sort of price-matching, but this store is just a rip-off. I wanted to return the item, but the store gives only a store credit or exchange, which I was never told during the purchase. I love supporting local stores and businesses, but when they try to rip-off people and do not even have a refund policy, it makes me want to cry.

I love Ambiance! Superb style, amazing/helpful staff, a great selection of all my favorite brands, awesome candles & giftable items, and they send me a birthday coupon in the mail that I adore. I stop by a couple times a month, and I tend to buy myself a Free People dress each month. The staff are very attentive and helpful with stylizing wardrobes. I recommend Ambiance not only for every day wear, but also for special occasions. Not to mention, thier accessories have completed multiple of my outfits. Thank you, Ambiance!

Selection is hit or miss and overpriced. Staff is unfriendly and rude. Shop Avanti or Black Water for a more pleasurable shopping experience.

My wife and I head in there when downtown and it's open, friendly and full of unique clothes, art and jewelry. The owner seems to mix it up and bring a variety of new items in for my wife... to spend our money;)  It's in the perfect location in the heart of downtown. Great store. I recently filmed a viral video and the staff was kind enough to let me work near them. Very friendly people... which is what prompted me to take a moment to comment.

Sunset North Car Wash
Super friendly OUTSIDE staff. 12.99 for outside cleaning, car came out looking spotless. Very happy with service. :)  upon further inspection....you're better off going to a spray booth and doing it yourself. Lol i detailed my car shortly after and couldn't believe how many spots were missed or how much dirt was left behind!

Both of the car washes do a great car wash.  They use great Care with your car.

blow and go. ended up cleaning my truck myself when they were "done". don't waste you're money here.

Been here many times over many years, always happy friendly service. Would recommend to anyone, could be faster but then quality would be lacking

I made the mistake of bringing my car here to have it detailed. They may be fine at a regular car wash, but DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR HERE FOR A DETAIL! They did a very poor job considering that they had it for 4 hours and charged me $250! I should have left it overnight with Hugo at Wizard of Wax, for $25 more.

The Tire Store
This is my new favorite tire store!!  While in the middle of a busy work day both the front tires on my tractor came off their rims due to a heavy load.   Carlos must have seen the desperate look on my face when I drove up because he expertly had both tires repaired in 5 minutes and I was back on my way!  Expert service with smile.  A great team!

Wonderful customer service! We have come here several times for new tires, tire repairs and alignment. Always impressed with how fast and efficient the team is! Fair prices too!

Been going there for over 20 years. Great guys behind the desk and really good prices. Only 4 stars because they are so popular (busy) that it takes a while for your work to get done.

Been going for years. A big operation, quick service (either that or you'll see a huge tire selling and repairing machine in motion if you go in when they're busy), free alignment checks with new tires purchased and other services offered.
Good guys and good prices.

Went in on my lunch hour with a nail in my tire. Joe had my truck in and out, before my hour was up. Fast completely professional, polite service! They are the best!

Second time I've used Cheap Wheels.   This service is great for when you are having your car fixed after a fender bender. Low rates, clean non-smoking cars, what more do you need?

AutoZone
The staff greeted me as soon as I walked in the door and offered to help me right away. I had and unusual request, and they did their best to find a solution. Best of all, their prices were a lot lower than the competition!

Have everything auto related you would expect. Nothing special though.  Parking lot a bit small. Employees polite and respectful, somewhat knowledgeable enough to help with most things. Pretty clean shop, parking lot has garbage all over ground though,  not prettiest store I've been to.

Pretty average Autozone. Staff is usually helpful. Has decent stock on hand for the vehicles I've needed parts for which has been quite a few times over the years. Easy access from Higuera Street. 

Super helpful staff and good prices on most items. I got the atf I needed for less than half of amazon's price.

Folks who can give you quality parts and tool rentals free .

Quiky Car Wash
First time here. Driving from Oregon/ Dirty car. I had bought the $10.99 deal w tires cleaned. Tires weren‚Äôt cleaned as I‚Äôd hoped. Dane the manager was very helpful. Offered some tire wipes. Great service. Powerful free vacuums w wash purchase. Car looks fantastic now. Thank you :-)

It depends who's working on whether or not your car will need a 2nd go around.  Their gate service needs improvement, but they have free vacuums and are conveniently located off the 101 so stopping on my way home works out.  If the staff were more consistent, I'd have given them a 4/5 rating.

Excellent service at Calle Joaquin. The vacuum is much better there.

The car washes here are very reasonably priced and they always offer a dashboard cleaning wipe and air freshener when you pay. Their free vacuums are also super great! My car always looks brand new after going here.

The best way to keep your car clean. I've been a customer for over two years and have washed our cars countless times. We have the speed pass on two of our cars and the buy 4 get 1 recharge card  for my truck I don't drive as much. A great product at a great price. The vacuums work great and the facility is always very clean with friendly staff. I recommend them to all my customers and friends.

Budget Car Rental
First time renting a car and I had a great experience. My highest concern was unforeseen charges and I just received my final receipt and have not been over charged. 
Great no hassle experience! Would 10/10 do business there again. Car was great and service was on point.

Budget is fine, but this location is bad to rent cars.
Because their lot is small, they are unable to hold much inventory of cars and rely on transfers from other locations.  My car wasn't ready when they told me to come and didn't have a good ETA for the car.
 Customer service needs work.  I left for another company and now my day is brighter.

The job application/interview for this location must go something like this:
"Are you snarky, bitchy, always arrive at least 45 minutes late to work, and are you more interested in chatting & texting with your friends than helping the customers?"
"Yeah, I guess that's true."
"OK, great. You're hired."

I should not have to call ahead to find out if the location is actually open (even though the posted hours say they are); or worse yet, I should not have to sit in the parking lot for an hour calling the 800 number to find out how to pick up my car because no one is at the rental office; I should not have to wonder or call ahead to make sure  the car that I reserved *months* ago will actually be there, or if I will have to pay for the car @ 1 location and then drive to a second location to actually pick up the car. 
Ridiculous! This is no way to run a business! 

Poor service,  poor quality vehicles. The minivan we rented was badly stained inside and had a terrible odor.  When informed,  the staff replied "thats normal,  they all smell like that".  Lesson learned.  



Customer service left much to be desired right next to the unacceptable condition of the vehicle we rented. Seats were water-stained, scratches on several places on the vehicle, was not fully vacuumed, had a vibration in the front end, and if all that wasn't enough, they were less than concerned when I informed them of all this. Received a less than concerned apology. Would never rent from this budget again...also had to wait for this vehicle because the one I was supposed to take had a service light on. Very disappointed.

Laguna Lake Shell Service
They are in a great location but getting back on Madonna can confuse tourists

Great spot on corner.  Car wash and decent gas prices. Also good central location for lovr area

Good gas station, clean and well maintained. It has a good carwash in the back and you get a discount on gas with purchase of a wash.

The parking is terrible here you have to park in a parking lot by the strip mall just to walk in and buy something if you're not buying gas there's no place to park

Bathroom is kinda grody, and often people lock the keys in it. However, the rest of the station is fairly clean and well maintained. It's easy to get to from Madonna or LOVR, which is nice. Usually comparable prices to most of the stations in SLO.

Left Coast T-Shirt Co
Awesome service and turn around time! Really made our event shirts shine!

Left Coast is AMAZING. I was in SLO for a conference last week and discovered that the t-shirts I had ordered from another company for the event were printed incorrectly. I called Keith at Left Coast and he was able to turn around a new (and totally perfect) order for me within 24 HOURS! I couldn't believe it. Fantastic experience! I will be ordering everything from Left Coast now - they will ship anywhere!

Awesome service! Great design and really quick service. Would recommend.

Great people, and always willing to help you figure out what will work within your budget.

Left Coast T-Shirt Company is undoubtedly the best screenprinting and embroidery service in SLO County.  We have been ordering our uniforms for the past five years, every order is top notch and the staff truly stands by their work.  The design team is very in tune with our needs.  Not to mention, the exposure our company has created by implementing clothing with our business logo. Without Left Coast it wouldn't have been possible.  Thank you!!

Hertz
Wonderful staff and they did everything to help me out, I appreciate the work and what they have to do to get things done for me.

Got a car here because the dealer had to keep my car overnight.  

The staff was nice enough but the car was terrible. 

The car was at least two years old which I didn't expect thinking car rental places update their cars every year.  The car smelled really bad like cigarettes.  I had to take the car back and get a second car (also older) which smelled very bad like cigarettes except this time someone tried to cover it up with something that smelled like Ax body spray.

At this point I had to pick up my child from daycare and had no option but to keep it. I have a very sensitive wife and three year old and this just doesn't work.  

If you are going to rent a car that smells like cigarettes you plain and simple are not running your business properly.

I will never ever rent from this place in San Luis Obispo again.

Go with Enterprise, Avis, anything but Hertz.

Very welcoming group, if you have never heard of Eastern Catholics and / or didn't realize they exist here in the west, check these guys out, they have everything Orthodoxy has, and most people don't care enough about theology to care about the difference. This is a English language church without any notable ethnic orientation. If you want Greeks, go next door where the Greek Orthodox have a nice church.

Villa Service Center
Very happy with the Villa"s service. Had to leave a car. They offered a ride to and from my home which is 10 miles away.  Also they diagnosed an issue which, as it turned was a simple and inexpensive fix. Prior to that a different auto service company had diagnosed the issue as a complex and very expensive one. I am grateful to have found Villa Automotive.

They definitely go the extra mile for you.  Friendly service and accommodating.

Best place to get your smog check  in slo.

We are from out of town and this was the only place I could find open on Sunday close to me. The estimate I received was very fair. I was was told this might be a 2 day job (as it was a Sunday and parts availability might be an issue). My wife and I were provided transport by Villa Service Center to a car rental agency. The work on my truck was completed  a few hours later and we were back on the road. Great place, great service! 

Really good service. This was my first time there and I was impressed.

CVS
The staff are amazing!!! Feel like family! Always supportive and helpful. Number one CVS of all.

Towed 4 customer cars simultaneously, including my wheelchair accessible vehicle.

I'm (did not park in handicap spot) and they towed my vehicle after being told to wait on an Rx that should have already been filled. My wife waited in line forever to "pickup," it wasn't filled for some reason, she was told to come back in 30min, she informed the cashier that we were going across the street to Wells Fargo and we came back in 30min, as instructed, only to find my wheelchair accessible vehicle was towed - along with 3 other customer vehicles according to the tow truck driver.

There was a queue to yell at the manager and one person was beyond angry. It cost us 250, which I better be reimbursed for it. 

First of all, this store has been in a death spiral for many years now, and this shows how petty and self-loathing the management and floor staff are because they hate their jobs and likely, themselves.

Anyone reading this - do yourselves a favor, save yourself the unneeded stress, and go to Rite Aid a few blocks down the road. 

Their store is nicer, staff is nicer, and you won't get towed within 30min eventhough you're a customer.

Helpful staff, knowledgeable and patient pharmacists, good selection, short lines (except at the pharmacy - expect a 20 minute wait most times of the day) and great prices make this the place to stop if you need just about anything. Parking is not usually a problem either, even though it is located near the center of town.

WORST CVS PHARMACY EVER!!!!!! I go in ONCE A MONTH AND ALWAYS HAVE EN ISSUE WITH GETTING MY PRESCRIPTION. THE STAFF HAS NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE DOING!!!! THEY SENT ME TO THE WRONG LOCATION TO PICK UP MY PRESCRIPTION THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE. EVEN THOUGH I WAS ALERTED IT WAS READY. NEVER GOING BACK. SWITCHING PHARMACYS FOR MY NEXT REFILL.

Standard service. Nothing special. The self serve photo development is very convenient.

Farm Supply Company
Farm Supply is our company's go to store for irrigation supplies and hand tools. They have extremely knowledgeable and friendly staff. Highly recommend them to anyone looking for a quality supplies and good service. - Luke Huskey, Greener Environments Landscaping

I went to Farm Supply in San Luis Obispo recently to find jeans with no rips or tears (an apparent trend -yuck) I got steered by a helpful associate to the perfect Wrangler jeans for me. I have never had jeans that fit so well! I had never shopped there before, but my husband suggested it and it made sense. Good call - I'll be back. And no, I don't have a farm or ranch!

Great experience at Farm Supply! They have so much you need in one trip. Great place!

Nice store have everything you need for your home ,ranch or farm

Farm Supply on Tank Farm Road in SLO is one of my favorite local nurserys!  It is always a fun experience to find healthy, unusal plants, get a special order, or gain knowledge from the "happy to help" nursery staff. The associated store with farming, pet, and horse supplies and country decor/clothing  is also a great experience!

========================================================
Enterprise Rent-A-Car
The scariest, most dangerous experience I have had on the road.  I rented a 2017 Cadillac CTS sedan from Enterprise.  The area where the cars were located was a complete mess.  They handed the keys from the office area and told me to find it in stall 18.  Cars were stacked in this parking lot and it took 3 guys jockeying cars so that I could pull out of the parking lot.  Clearly they were understaffed and rushing to check customers in and get customers out of the lot.  As I pulled out of the lot (finally), I noticed a warning light on in the car.  It said the right back tire had low pressure.  I stopped and got out of the car and checked the tire and visually, it was fine...it did not appear lower than the other tire and I just figured that they checked this stuff before they give a car to customers.  I continued on my way from SLO to Sacramento and on I-5 north, near Tracy, CA, the right tire blew as I was in the fast lane, going about 70mph.  I was swerving all over the road as I was trying to control the car while driving on the metal part of the tire.  I managed to get across all four lanes and park on the side of I-5 without hitting another car or semi-truck.  I'm still not sure how I survived...extremely blessed.  The Enterprise quality control procedures failed.  No one should have rented this car.  It should not have been on the lot.  I talked to the Regional Manager of this location and requested a copy of the checklist on this car.  I have not received anything or a call back on the results of his investigation and the request was made two weeks ago.  Needless to say, I rate this dangerous experience a 1 star.  If I could give a lesser rating, I would.

I had a very good experience with this car rental. We rented a minivan for a week and got a beautiful Chrysler with all the amenities. Everything worked great and the entire process was as smooth as one could ask for. I recommend them and would use them again.

We flew into San Luis Obispo via private plane and were very pleased with Enterprise. The rental counter, although just outside the terminal, was readily accessible and the young lady at the counter was very helpful. We will be back!

I picked up the Camry at the San Luis Obis Po, County Airport.  The attendant was very helpful and pointed me toward the parking lot.  
I drove approximately 450 miles in the area.  I Stayed for six days and
really enjoyed the beach at Avila Beach.  The Hearst Castle was another
interesting site to visit.  The Seals and Sea lions were fun to watch on the
beach at San Simone, California.
 Clerk made I got all the discounts I was entitled to for the six day rental fee.  No problems were encountered with the car.  I was surprised at the cost of fuel in California.

The Enterprise agent at the counter was extremely helpful and I will absolutely rent from Enterprise every time I need a rental.

Dave's Automotive
I have come into Dave's 3 or 4 times in the past year for various reasons (oil change, tune-up, etc). Every time I come in I get friendly service at a reasonable price. I really appreciate that Dave takes the time to talk to each customer. He genuinely cares and that's obvious the first time you meet him. I trust him and his advice and would recommend his shop to anyone.

Dave's Automotive understands how important our vehicles are to us. This is evident by the high level of professionalism offered with a sincere smile. Dave's Automotive is my "GO TO" mechanic shop. Prices are always fair and at times impressive. Dave also cares enough to install the best components into your vehicle. The turn around time for most average car care (oil changes, etc.,) are lightning fast. And for the more complicated matters (coolant system, timing belts, etc.,).... Dave will have you back on the road with confidence in no time at all. I have been using Dave's Automotive for many years now, servicing two everyday drivers and one Hot Rod of mine and each time for all these years the work has been consistently fantastic.  I would and do to this day, definitely recommend Dave's Automotive for you're baby. Thank you Dave for all you have done for me :^D

Consistently good service. My family has been going to him for several years for our cars. Each time I end up smiling in a "that was easy" kind of way. I've had great experiences whether I had an appointment or not. They do a great job with basics like oil changes and smog checks as well as repairs and diagnosing problems. Plus there's a crazy number of magazines in their waiting room.

Smog check. In, out, on time and affordable. Woot!

This was the best experience with a mechanic I have ever had! Dave seems to be just a really fair down to earth kind of guy! Charged about half of what other mechanics would and gave me options instead of just doing what he felt like and charging for it. My family is now going to use him for the work trucks and our personal vehicles.

Just got a start OK n Xmas they have good things for teen girls

Great select & nice service for a bargain store.
I do appreciate their kitchen & gourmet section the most.
You can also sometimes find great deals there or in the towel section.
Sometimes you can find bargains in the Shampoo section if you
are into higher end stuff.  Clothes sadly reflect the lower quality stuff
that they now sell in retails stores...so sad.

CVS
Pharmacy is the worst experience. Every single time. Wait in line for 20 min at drop off, another 20 at pickup. They seriously need to hire more people or something. People calling and put on hold, I've had to call and been on hold 20 min. Go to rite aid, they are so efficient there. Plus I've had multiple times CVS say they are out of the medication and have to order and I go to rite aid they have it. Not to mention when I did order they forgot to call me when it came in! Go somewhere else if you can! I only come back because it's the closest to me.

Generally nice pharmacy dept.. Nice friendly service.

Nice pharmacy, good selection of wines, snacks, over the counter medical products.

Never go to this pharmacy, they never have the script I need and poor service! If you do have to go there always check to make sure it is there because I can almost say for sure it won't be there when u need it!!!

Asian Auto
I looked for YEARS after I moved to this area for a mechanic I could trust, and Gary Finch is that person and then some.  He does excellent work (part of his cred is having worked for Toyota in the past) for a fair price, and can usually make time for someone who drops by with a question about a new sound coming from their car, or something.  I almost let an instance of gruffness put me off, but I can't tell you how glad I am that I didn't.  If he doesn't work on something like air-conditioning or smogging, he refers you to someone reliable who does.  Very convenient to downtown SLO, too, just around the corner from the intersection of South St. and Higuera.  I just have enormous respect for him.

I am usually one to put stuff off like getting my car fixed because I think its going to be a terrible experience. But this was not the case at Asian Auto, Gary was extremely helpful he diagnosed the problem and even suggested that I take it to the dealership because it could be under warranty (keep in mind my car is 6 years old and I have no extended warranty) it was under warranty and Gary saved me a large chunk of money. I would definitely suggest Asian Auto to anyone who is looking for a honest mechanic.

So I've taken my car to Gary twice now, one for a door mechanism problem and one for a power steering leak. He got the work done for the price (extremely lower than a dealership) he quoted me on. I thought I would have to replace the hoses for my power steering, but he experimented and found a small O-ring leak instead, which turned out to be much cheaper than I had thought it'd be originally. I'm a poor poly student, and this guy is extremely honest and upfront. If you have a lexus or toyota with a problem, bring it to this guy.

Excellent gas station. They usually have some of the best prices in SLO other than the Costco. I recommend stopping here for gas when possible.

Cheap price and handy stuff!!!

The gas is the cheapest in town. The bathrooms are cleaner than most gas station bathrooms and inside, rather then when we you have to go outside with a key and it's creepy out. The best is the service. Some even remember your name. I've also had friends who have worked there and have had nice things to say about the management. Plus! They have a Subway. Woot!

Excellent micro beer selection although high prices these days. Friendly staff most of the time. Always a pleasure to shop here! 

They are always super nice and have a good selection of beers. 

I went in for one thing... BEER. And I wasn't let down. The selection was awesome and the gentleman that helped me was full of info and willing to locate beers that I had on my list, even if they didn't normally carry them. Amazing selection and all of it cold.

Online fine payment service constantly down. No one answering phones, and no room for anymore voice mails. Bad deal all around. But hey, the buildings interesting looking so they got that going for them. One star

I paid my traffic fine via money order and got a notice 4 months later saying i didnt pay it... and everytime i try to call they dont answer

Only leaving one star because that's the lowest rating. Don't waste your time/minutes/sanity calling, you'll just hear "this is the superior court....there is no room available to leave your message....goodbye." And you'll be disconnected! Funny how the people trying to face their tickets/issues get thrown obstacles like this. I tried calling on a Friday and waited until Monday (today); just to find out calling does nothing. If the court can't get their business straightened out, why should they expect anyone else to? Way to set a good example.

Traffic department phone operators are rude before you can even say hello. Don't bother being polite. Zero reciprocation.

Gladly took my money, gladly won't answer any call. Awful service, I've called over 100 times today and never got through. Unprofessional court of law...

Peak Dentistry
They really go out of their way to make you comfortable. Dr. Slade is very good and explains everything very clearly

Over this place. Nice office but Not an organize practice

I have had nothing but great experiences at Peak Dentistry. Dr. Slade with the help of Dr. Milch have really turned that office around and the level of professionalism would be hard to match. The office remodel is absolutely beautiful. The staff make you feel comfortable from the minute you walk in the door. Treatment went flawless from my cleaning to a filling. I recommend Peak Dentistry to all my friends!

First dentist visit in a long time today. I was nervous but they put me at ease right away! Great personal, friendly and thoughtful service. They go out of their way and can teach you without talking down to you. Very nice, fashionable office also. 

I have had a lot of dental work done and the work I have received from Dr Slade is some of the best. I would recommend him to anyone.

Kohl's San Luis Obispo
So disappointed in Kohl's.  I was underwhelmed at the sales available. For instance men's socks $20 and 1/2 second pair.  Children's clothes, women's PJ's...very few shoes. Dismal.  I left my cart  and walked out of the store today.  At Target, I was able to get everything I needed, including small $5 stocking stuffers on every aisle end rack. That's it for Kohl's. H Smirl

The staff is just awesome! Our shopping experiences are always pleasant with the most helpful and genuinely friendly staff!

Lots of clothing, housewares, jewelry in stock, but over time the quality seems to be decreasing... Polo shirts are now blended instead of all cotton, for instance. If you get on their mailing lists and stack coupons on top of sales, there are bargains to be had. "Regular" prices have to be high in order to make those discounts possible, so don't get burned by buying at full price.

Excellent variety of clothing and some toys and electronics.  I thought it to be a bit pricey, but that's to my taste.

Great prices and located near other stores.

SLO Dental Practice: Disbel Mansilla DDS
I highly recommend SLO Dental. Dr. Mansilla is the best Dentist i have ever had! She took the time to explain exactly what i needed and why. Dr. Mansilla is one of the most professional dentists I have ever met. She is kind, gentle, and detailed-oriented. A great attribute about Dr . Mansilla is that she communicates with you about your teeth as she performs the work. Dr. Mansilla answered all of my questions and gave me recommendations to improve the quality of my brushing/flossing/oral hygiene. She laughs, makes jokes and makes you feel comfortable as a new patient. The entire staff is friendly and helpful. I'm so happy i found this place!!!!

Dr. Mansilla & her staff are efficient & hard working & fun! My husband & I have been going to her for several years & trust her work completely. After failed root canal from 2 other dentists, Dr. Mansilla successfully corrected it.
She's the best!

Dr. Mansilla was never respectful of my time and appointments would always go over. She would bounce between rooms and attempt to see multiple patients at the same time. When getting a tooth filled she would forcefully shake my cheek as she was injecting novocaine. It was disturbing and I did not understand the need for the forcefulness. I had a crown put in by Dr. Mansilla and she chipped it while putting it in so it looked like I had a small silver filling in the tooth. She offered to have another one made but, it had taken so long to come in and my appt to put it in had gone well over an hour that I did not want to come back and deal with it again. So, I have a very expensive crown with a chip in it I didn't want fixed because it was more time lost in her chair. I left her practice shortly after this incident. It was the last straw.

Whoa !!! Dr Mansilla ¬†and Dr Echeverriy have done a very good job on my teeth. They were a mess and now I have a healthy mouth!!
Quick, professional, nice and so helpful that's Including all the staff !!!
Thank you so much !

I am always afraid to visit a new dentist.  Just like I am usually afraid to visit a new mechanic. There are just so many different ways that a customer can be disappointed. I will say that my first visit to SLO Dental was great! From the receptionist who took my appointment and followed up, to the friendly staff at the office and the professional atmosphere, everything about my appointment ran smoothly like a machine.

The staff was helpful and courteous and i never felt rushed. The dentist I saw was knowledgeable and gave me some great advice for a better brushing technique. 

I have to go back next week for a filling, but I know I'm in good hands! 

Thanks SLO Dental for making me feel at ease!

Central Coast Gastroenterology: Mundorf Jeffrey B MD
Love Dr. Mundorf and Cindy, his office manager! After seeing many doctors over the course of my life, Dr. Mundorf ordered the right series of tests to help me determine I needed to see a specialist, which now has me on the path to recovery! Always prompt in their follow-ups...I highly recommend them to anyone needing a local GI doctor!

How does this guy stay in business? Most calous, heartless physician I've ever encountered, in any field. Left us believing my wife had cancer, then five weeks later, after returning from vacation, "The test results were in error. Sorry." Even that message didn't warrant a phone call, he waited til next appointment to deliver the good news. By the way, the test results were not in error, the error was in his interpretation of the results. I pray if he or his family ever gets ill, they receive care exactly equal to what he delivers to our community. 

After getting an upper GI xray done at French, I waited 2 weeks to get the results and NEVER got a call back. I had to call them to get the results and ask how my care would be changed or continued. Then a receptionist read my results off to me over the phone and I didn't have a clue what they meant and she said that it meant nothing. They didn't find anything, that my results were "boring". 
So what does that mean for my care? Also nothing. No follow up, no medical advice. 
I was advised by the same front desk person that if I had continuing problems with my stomache, that I should seek medical attention.

I will, but not from your doctor's office, madam.
The ONLY reason that I didn't give this office 1 star only was that I liked the attention and explanation of procedures I received from the PA there. I NEVER saw the doc and the desk staff are not terribly helpful.
So if you have coverage that will allow you to see someone else, you might want to go elsewhere.

Apple Higuera Street
Long story short, got a iphone 6 for $325 30 days ago with 90 days warranty. Device stared having issues (soft/hardware we don't know). We tried everything they said to fix it but no luck, (couple of trips involved) they couldn't  fix it either. Apple can only give me $125 now for that device under "warranty" when I paid 325 30 days ago. The wait times are also extremely long but I wont complain on that since its the only store in the area. Staff are nice, professional and friendly though

This is my second time needing to go into the Apple Store for two different reasons, but in both cases I was welcomed in and treated very kindly and professionally. The first time was a while ago, and I had to wait because it was a walk in appointment, the second time I booked a genius appointment and was in and out in less than 30 minutes. In both situations, I was lucky to work with Miles (one of the geniuses at Apple)! Miles has been very educational and has outlined my options in both cases to where I feel as informed as possible when making decisions. 

It's really important to me that I can trust someone with anything that I would purchase at apple, whether its my phone or my laptop. If everyone there is as awesome as Miles then I will definitely be returning for any and all Apple things.

My boyfriend and I were in this store for a good 20-25 minutes and no one asked us if we needed help. We had to reach out to someone even though we had many people walk by and say nothing. Finally, when we got someone‚Äôs attention they were very rude and unhelpful. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt reccomend this location.

It's nice and sleek and expensive, just like you would expect.  Folks were decent and staff were pretty friendly.  Nothing above average, or below average for the store.  The location can be difficult to reach in peak traffic times, but otherwise nothing good or bad to say.

They are well staffed, but the staff isn't necessarily friendly.  They are a bit pushy, and the person we were dealing with was very sarcastic.  Came in to get a new iPhone and it took nearly 2 hours, the sales person I was dealing with was joking about how long it was going to take, but it took longer!  It came to the point that the manager had to come out to get it to work and then it only took 15 minutes.  Manager was super nice and helpful but the other people were terrible.

I would not recommend them because of their poor customer service for any maintenance or system additions. They do not return repeated phone calls or follow up on requests. 

As far as monitoring my alarms, they have been very good.

CAL COAST Construction
Ive used Cal Coast Construction several times over the years, and know Caleb, the owner to be an honest and reliable man who treats every project like his reputation is riding on the outcome. His attention to detail, and commitment to excellence have made Cal Coast Construction an obvious first choice for me. 

I've never met a more professional contractor; he always shows up when he says he will, and finishes projects on time, and it doesn't hurt that he's good looking, and always wearing  clean uniform :)

Caleb has done a few jobs for us. He's very cordial when working with us and honest.  Takes time to explain the details and follows through.  Highly recommended.

Amazing remodeling contractor. The owner is very nice and respectful and the quality of work is always great. Has a good crew that is very trustworthy.

Drive Customs
Had a new antenna installed as my old one broke off. Overall way better service then the other guys in slo. Very professional

I went to Drive Customs for my new deck and sub two seperate times and both times were awesome.  Very knowledgeable and professional.  I've even gone in multiple times and asked questions after my installs and they have been more then helpful to help with my problems.  Prices are reasonable and work is top notch.  This is the only place I go in SLO for my cars.

I live in a town a 3hr. drive from This company and have made this company my go to place for any and all stereo work to be done on my car. I have had alot of stereo installs done to my cars in the past and consider Drive Customs to be the BEST by far. Jay and his crew go that extra mile and are in my opinion top notch (the BEST) in all areas of stereo installs and knowledge. i don't mind making that long drive to have the work being done to my car done right and perfect. 

Any other services are less professional.

I definitely agree that this place has excellent customer service. I live in Santa Maria and Jesse, the owner, drove out to my job to pick up my car to install my stereo. He then drove my car back to me at the end of my work day. Everything looked extremely professional and the sound was amazing. I could tell that they take pride in their work and I will definitely be going there again to have more things installed. I absolutely recommend Drive Customs to anyone who wants to have top quality products and a professional install.

This place is the best kept secret for plants on the Central Coast! I've been buying plants from them for many many years. The plants are beautifully maintained and so happy. I've purchased African violets, orchids, and recently a beautiful palm. The staff are always experts in caring for the plants, and they will special order. Feel free to share this treasure.

Whoa !!! Dr Mansilla ¬†and Dr Echeverriy have done a very good job on my teeth. They were a mess and now I have a healthy mouth!!
Quick, professional, nice and so helpful that's Including all the staff !!!
Thank you so much !

The first dental office I've ever liked. Comforting, friendly and professional. They are very conscientious of keeping pain to a minimum. I have total trust, and confidence, with the front office, hygienists and dentists.

I have been going to Dr. Mansilla for years. They are a very efficient and skilled group of professionals. Dr. Mansilla is the best dentist I have ever had and I am in my 50's! Here team works well together, they are always happy. They are not any more expensive then any other dental office! 
I would highly recommend!! 

Assembly line dentistry, plain and simple. More interested in flipping chairs quickly for billing purposes than caring about their patients (and it shows).
It had been a while since my last cleaning because I didn't have a dentist in this area, and so my cleaning took a while longer than usual. The poor hygienist was doing a thorough job and told me why it was taking her longer, which I totally understood and I appreciated her efforts.
Unfortunately, every 3 minutes a lady who I assume was the office manager kept coming by asking her how much longer, and to please hurry up! The hygienist repeatedly told her that it would not be much longer, but that she needed to reach some areas that were tough. A minor argument ensued while I was sitting there with my mouth hanging open. 
I felt sorry for the hygienist because she was very conscientious about her work and wanted to do a good job, but evidently she was holding up the assembly line by doing so.
Then the topper of the whole experience came a week or so later when I had to go back for some dental work. They kept me in the office lobby waiting for 50 minutes past my appointment time, and then the office manager came out (after the lobby was empty), and said that she needed to inform me that she called my insurance carrier and that my price was now double!
Why she called the carrier, and why she waited until the time of my appointment to do so is beyond me. So there I am, waiting to go in and get a couple of cavities filled, and she comes out and says that I now need to pay $800 right then! I said I'd get back to her, and that I wasn't getting the work done that day. You should have seen the look on her face, like I'd passed gas or something. 
And the funny part is that I was complaining about this later to a family member and she told me that they did the EXACT same thing to her! Except they actually had her in the chair with her mouth numb and waiting for the Dr. to do a root canal, and the office/account manager came up to her chair and told her that the insurance billing was changed and that she owed them double what they had told her, and that she needed to make payment arrangements immediately. WHILE SHE WAS IN THE CHAIR!
I have since read the reviews on this dentist and the SAME complaints are repeated over and over again, and they all sound like they experienced the same "bait and switch" tactics I did. They quote you a price, then come back at the very last minute and raise it.

If you're looking for a caring, family-oriented dentist who won't treat you like a billing-number, this is not the dentist you want to go to.....seriously.

Shervin Gholian D.M.D., M.M.Sc.
		
Customer Service, Environment, Wait Time, Quality, Other
‚ÄúI've never had such great care nor overall ideal experience in any other professional service situation!! The staff is efficient and delightful, the office is extremely clean and state of the art with customer care & comfort top of mind! Dr Gholian is a 110% pure expert at his craft offering clear explanation (whether good news or less than) and gentle, precision hand at correction as needed! I might actually look forward to another root canal!! I highly recommend Dr Gholian and his awesome staff with confidence!!‚Äù

You couldn't ask for a better dr or a better experience. I have had 4 procedures done by dr gholian starting back in 2012. Everything has held up fantastically. It's pretty hard to make a root canal a relaxing experience but this office has it as close as it can be. They really do care about the patients. I had what I thought was a communication problem between two dentists and this office (as well as the other involved) bent over backwards to help me resolve it even though in the end it turned out to be me misunderstanding what was going on. That is a surprisingly rare quality today. If your teeth and long term health are important to you, you need to see dr gholian. 

I was referred to Dr. Gholian by my dentist, Dr Ng.  Since I'm thrilled with the care I've received from Dr. Ng, I trusted his judgement in the referral. I'm so thankful that I had such a positive experience with Dr. Gholian.

Dr Gholian thoroughly assessed my dental needs and decided that I needed a root canal. As some may know, if the Endo can't address the problem with a root canal, an extraction is the other option. Dr. Gholian's expertise and assessment helped identify and address my dental needs. (He saved my tooth!)  However, it is his total focus on the patient and the patient's needs that sets him above the crowd. I have extensive dental work in my mouth...implants, bridges, etc.  I also suffer from major problems with my TMJ (the joint in your jaw that suffers damage when one grinds the teeth).  Added to this, I let Dr. Gholian know that I suffer from anxiety, so everything is a stress for me. 

Dr. Gholian was very caring and provided information about every step in the procedure. He was very responsive to my care needs, always making me feel that my concerns were number one. If I had to have another root canal, I'd run to his office.  Well, dental work is still a trauma for me but he does a fantastic job.  Thank you, Dr. Gholian and your team, for helping me get through the stress and anxiety.   A loyal patient, Irene

Dr. Gholian did my root canal and crown back in 2013 after I endured agonizing pain while waiting to have my insurance be ready to go. Very knowledgeable and professional doctor and staff. I am 100% satisfied! 

 The front office girls are so nice!!!

Trader Joe's
Parking can be frustrating after work hours due to small lot shared with Food For Less, Starbucks, Mission Vet, Round Table, Taco Ricos & a few other small shops, but worth the effort.  Good for quick grocery stops for people food, but not pet food.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Good, fresh produce; bakery and frozen food items.  Daily food samplings and coffee.

We love it! But it‚Äôs a very busy location and you have to know when to go to avoid really long lines and out of stock. Staff is always super helpful and friendly.

I always love finding something special here. One of my favorite places to find great cards to send to my favorite people. Added bonus is that it is all fair trade.

it seems like a small grocery store but inside are many treats and stuff that you can't find anywhere such as dairy free ice cream sandwiches. The store also has lots of seasonal items like butternut squash and delicata squash. The store sells beautiful flowers as well.

Super friendly staff, fabulous food at great prices and they have British crumpets that I can't get anywhere else, love their cheese and pate selection. They are incredibly community minded, the best grocery store in the area for supporting their community

Photo Shop
I cannot recommend this shop enough.  They are thoroughly helpful and not pushing a sales agenda, it was such a pleasure dealing with a shop that is passionate about what they do and truly want their customers to get what they need, and know how to use the equipment that they purchased.  I felt well taken care of there.

Has 35 mm development and quicker return of photos than most pharmacy departments. Has full camera sales and equipment.

Small but had good product.  Knowledgeable staff. Top name brands and good selection .

Staff were friendly and helpful. I only bought some cleaning supplies, but I got some good information from the guy at the counter, and the shop seemed to have a lot of the things you may need that you couldn't find at a regular store. It was pricier than online, however that's sort of to be expected when buying niche stuff at a physical location 

The only full-service photo store in 150 mile radius of here. They have everything you need,  I bought a nice camera bag there for my 6D.

Randall Lonsbrough D.D.S., Inc.
I saw Dr Lonsbough for a device for my sleep apnea. The office is in a beautiful location. The staff is very welcoming. The Dr asked me several questions about my snoring. He explained the device that could be made for me. I have been using my Tap appliance and am very pleased as well as my wife!! Friendly Doctor highly recommend. 

My experience with Dr Lonsbrough  was difficult.   He replaced my tooth with a prosthesis.  It was painful for me to go through part of the examination partly because my mouth is sore from medication I am taking. .  I did tell them about this while taking x-rays and impressions, it was painful, and the staff told me "it should not be hurting" as to indicate it was not hurting?  I also shared with them that I had trauma as a child in that area and have had several l surgeries.    When I returned for my prosthesis, it hurt like hell when they put it in, and they said the same thing, "It shouldn't hurt."    Shortly after that, Dr. Lonsbrough, came into the room.  I asked him a couple of questions, and he answered by saying, "Well if you'll stop talking long enough  I will explain it to you."  I have NEVER had anyone say this to me.  Dr. Lonsbrough, you should not speak to your patients that way!!  Don't forget that we are paying for your nice car and home.... I think he is rude and I am hoping to get a referral to see someone else.   The staff was polite, but I would  not recommend Dr. Lonsbrough.  This is my very first review for anyone

Dr. Lonsbrough was recommended to me by  my dentist because I was having problems with my upper bridge. I went to meet Dr. Lonsbrough after several visits discussing different procedures along with question and answer sessions. we decided on an upper prosthesis on fore implants. I am pleased with my smile and would recommend Dr. Lonsbrough highly to anyone. After three years of treatment I have always found Dr. Lonsbrough to be professional and he instilled in me confidence in him. I visited three other prosthodontists prior to deciding on Dr. Lonsbrough. I have always found Dr. Lonsbroughs STAFF to be professional, helpful and courteous.

Having moved away from the Central Coast I have come to appreciate many things; one of those is the great experience I had with Dr. Lonsbrough and his staff. You can't go wrong with his caring and expertise. The quality of his dental treatment is beyond anything you will ever see.

I have been seeing Dr. Lonsbrough for about 3 yrs now.  His office is great.  I never have to wait to be seen, staff is amazing and for the most part treatment is painless and I even had an implant placed.  When ever I over hear people talking about dentists I tell them they should go see Randy.

Always fantastic service at the photo center. They are amazing, great personalities and do quality work. They go above and beyond to get our crazy orders done every month.

My wife and I were out-of-town customers and therefore had some difficulty finding the various products. The store staff were extremely pleasant and helpful in getting us all of the items we needed, as well as providing price checks. Great customer service!

Excellent customer service!  Very helpful staff and managers that go out of their way to assist you!  I love our SLO Staples store!

Went in to do a return and the cashier that helped me was really rude and disconnected. He seemed to be very friendly with the customer before me though.

Great store, well stocked, friendly & helpfull employees

This place is wonderful.  I was seen by Mary and Atsuko(sp).  Both were extremely compassionate and made the experience of getting my recommendation painless.  I had walked in here expecting a shady bunch, but instead found a friendly, compassionate, and clean office ran by proffesional staff who took medical Cannabis seriously.

Picked up a card for a coop called "Ethnobotanica".  That place is great as well.  They're number's 1-877-POT-DELI!  I got a kick out of that!  Good people and even better meds.

E Carrie Ramirez, DDS & Pamela Dassenko, DDS
Easy to schedule appointments, excellent service in the dental chair as well as at the desk. I have never had any problems and I can say that they have proven to me that a healthy set of teeth is worth the money. I don‚Äôt dread going to the dentist any more!

Everything and everyone is personable and professional from the front desk personnel, hygienists and dental  assistants.  Both dentists, Dr. Dassenko and Dr Ramirez are highly skilled and experienced and aware of the latest breakthroughs in treating your teeth. I really like that they keep you on a schedule to maintain healthy teeth and gums.  You won't be disappointed with the firm.

After searching for a dental care professional after moving to the area in 2009, we finally found the best office in SLO County (and beyond)!  The entire staff is wonderful, helpful and you feel like good friends.

Thanks to all of the team!

I truly can‚Äôt say enough great things about this office! I‚Äôve always suffered from Dental anxiety due to bad experiences in the past but I can say this office is top notch. From the start the front staff, Jamie and Judy, were welcoming and very efficient. Melanie, one of the assistants, made me feel comfortable right from the start. Her calm personality made me feel more comfortable in the chair. Dr. Ramirez and Dr. Dassenko have taken care of my dental needs and I can undoubtably say they are the BEST. They provide the most up-to-date technology to make everything easier. I‚Äôve had all of the hygienists clean my teeth and they‚Äôre all very thorough while being gentle. They‚Äôve shared their knowledge and I can say I‚Äôve learned so much about my oral health and how to be as effective as I can be at home. I HIGHLY recommend this office!!

I am a patient of Dr Ramirez. I just had several fillings done and it was a great experience as far as dental experiences go. Dr Ramirez is very gentle and attentive. Danielle and Melanie did a great job assisting and making me feel comfortable. Front office staff very friendly and helpful. I can't say enough good things about this office. I would highly  recomend this office to friends, family, and anyone else.

Pacific Pediatric Dentistry
Dr. You and her staff are wonderful! My children enjoy going to their appointments. I know my children are well taken care of. Her assistants are great too! Mercia and Margaret are sweet to my kiddos. Dr. You is amazing. One of my daughters is sensitive to the process and is easily overwhelmed. Dr. You was very patient,  nurting and encouraged my daughter she could get through her filling. She reevaluated my daughter's situation to work out how she can finish her dental needs (more than just a filling). I wanted to just get it done but Dr. You recommended we wait a few weeks before going forward with finishing my daughter's teeth. Dr. You is thorough and my husband and I trust her with our three children (9, 8 and 4 years old). I highly recommend Dr. You and her staff!

We have always loved coming here. All of the staff is so nice! We have never felt pressured to do procedures and feel like there is always good communication. We love hygienist, Margaret! She is gentle, friendly and knowledgeable.

I have been using Pacific Pediatric Dentistry since my oldest daughter first needed a dentist. She's now 35. There has never been a bad experience for her or my other 3 children who have gone there. The youngest is 15 and I  still use Pacific Pediatric Dentistry. If you ask them, they will tell you that they love going to the dentist. I have Pacific Pediatric Dentistry to thank for this. They have been wonderful for the last 30 years  and still are.

We have been a patient here for several years and have always had excellent experiences.  Dr You is very kind, knowledgeable and skilled with children. Today, Mercia was our dental assistant, continuing our faith in Dr You‚Äôs office by treating my daughter with kindness, humor and patience.  My Daughter said on the way out, ‚ÄúWow, that went by really fast and didn‚Äôt hurt at all‚Äù.  Dr You and her staff, especially Mercia, are highly recommmended for any child‚Äôs dental needs.

All of the staff are very friendly and great with our kids! I'm happy to know that my kids are starting out with positive dental experiences.

Electricraft Inc
Electricraft recently helped our company with the electrical work on a couple projects. They were easy to communicate with, had very fast service, and went out of their way to work with our schedule. Highly recommend them for anyone needing electrical work on the Central Coast. - Luke Huskey, Greener Environments Landscaping

Beverly and her team are easy to work with. We reached out for a quote and got a response very quickly!

When it comes to something as vital and complicated as electrical work, you want the best and that is what Electricraft offers.  The electricians they have on their team are experts in their craft- they are incredibly knowledgeable, timely, and professional. Exceptional service!

I think that Electricraft is such a great local company.  They serve the needs of residential and commercial customers throughout SLO County (and from what I understand some big commercial projects out of the County too).  The business was formed here and has been run by multiple generations of a solid local family.

When you call in the first voice you'll probably hear is Bev's.  She is an absolute whiz at customer service and helping get people to the right solution.  Bev has sent out the perfect electrician to our house to patch up some bad work that was done prior to us buying the house.  She has also had electricians provide bids to us on overhead lighting and a new breaker box.  They were professionals through and through and stand by their work.  They won't be the lowest bid that you get but they will do it right the first time and stand by their work if it needs to be serviced or updated.  

As our family grows (and our energy use) we will probably get a bid from them on solar panels too.

Top tier electrician, not your average run of the mill contractor.  PROFESSIONAL.  Don't DIY your electrical it is not worth it

Would not recommend this store, staff was friendly at first, however was not up to date with flagship phone releases, and stated incorrect information. Additionally staff was uninterested and marginally rude to me when I was asking additional questions and discussing a roadblock I hit with Verizon. I left and went to the corporate Verizon store a few blocks north and found the staff to be much more knowledgeable and helpful, going as far as explaining to me how to fix an issue I was having with our plan. While The wait was longer at corporate, the service was superior to this retail store.

Super knowledgeable and friendly staff. Helped me find exactly what I needed and even took the time to teach me a thing or two. Awesome customer service. 

One Star in Lieu of zero stars.  This premium retail outlet is quite the opposite of premium.  I attempted to return a new smart phone on day 14 of the return policy and was told I was past my return date, though I wasn't.  This was confirmed by the Verizon corporate representative I spoke to on the phone not five minutes after I walked out of the store.  Verizon corporate bought my phone back immediately and noted this locations customer relations, or lack thereof.  This location is the reason I would stay away from retail stores.....

If you are accustomed to long wait times, staff who are anxious and impatient with your indecisiveness, and give you short answers without explanations or alternatives, then avoid coming here because the experience is just the opposite. Naomi and the other kind people here are very patient and put up with my quirky sense of humor and novice phone use and awareness. If I had one complaint, it is that no one knew of a sleazy sushi dive bar where I could meet some disgruntled ex-Verizon employees who were replaced during the strike of last year. I don't hold this against them.

Great customer service. You get what you pay for.

Chris W. Manning, DDS
I just went in and was very impressed with how painless he made my experience. I had chipped a large portion of one of my top front teeth at 8am. I called at 9 am and he was able to accommodate me for noon that same day! By 1pm I was out the door, smile looking good as new! I immediately set up my next appointment and can't wait to see how he can improve my smile. I will post again after I have some other work done.

Dr. Manning has been our dentist for over 12 years, and I don't mind saying that he is definitely worth visiting.  He has a very gentle touch, and his staff is the best.  He is very skilled at what he does, and when I had to have an extraction and implant, it was quick and painless.  He and his staff were very considerate of my fears, and made the whole experience worthwhile. It's been over a year since my implant and everything is great.  I love his office and staff and would definitely recommend him to anyone.  I've been a dental assistant for many years, and I don't mind saying that he is the best dentist I know.  I drive out of my way to visit twice a year and it's definitely worth it!

Dr Manning is the best there is.  He is very gentle and professional.  His equipment is up to date.

We are pleased to be gently serving our wonderful family of patients in SLO since 1994.  Our great staff strive to make every visit comfortable and caring.

Great staff and very gentle Dentist. Appointments always on time. Pain free.

Albert's Florist
We recently ordered birthday flowers for our mom from Albert‚Äôs, I needed to take the time to sing their praises because we could not have been happier with her arrangement! We ordered the flowers in the keepsake China teapot (what an amazing idea! It‚Äôs the gift that continues giving!!) She said it was ‚Äúthe most beautiful bouquet she had ever received‚Äù! How rare it is when a product actually exceeds the way it looks in the order picture! We ordered online from Colorado, and every step was smooth sailing. We are so happy that we chose to spend the extra couple dollars to support a local company- Albert‚Äôs is 100% deserving of their 5-star rating!

I highly recommend Albert's Florist!! 100% The lady who answered the phone is the Best! She helped me place the order and was very lovely and very helpful! I really appreciated all her help and had a wonderful experience. If you're not sure what type of flower arrangement you're looking for? call them and they will help you out! Very Happy.

I called to get a delivery made to a friend. The lady who helped me knew exactly what I was asking about and even worked on the price a bit with me. I will most likely be sending flowers on that area again. I will always go back to this flower store. They treat customers like friends. They got my vote!
Thanks...

They were recommended to me by the Cal Poly plant store and were excellent. Great service, the flowers were beautiful and fresh and delivered on time.

I have used Albert's numerous times to send my aunt flowers. We live in England and our trust in them has never been questioned. They have reliably delivered exactly what we ordered, to a high standard. Our thanks to to them for their wonderful service.

Urology Associates-San Luis: Kuntze Joseph R MD
I had a great experience with dr. Kuntz and his staff!  He's very down-to-earth explains things in terms I can understand and it was more than willing to take the time I needed.  I wouldn't hesitate to return.

Dr Kuntz is not caring and his PA is worse; she does not call you back even when you have an extreme infection and the receptionist tells her at 8 am you are in crisis.  NO CALL.all day while the pain is unbearable.  They called a script in to the wrong pharmacy.  They did not advise me until after 5 pm where it was sent while I waited at the first pharmacy at noon.  Office is run like they are there for themselves not the patient.
I am done with them.  This is the TEMPLETON office.

He doesn't care if he calls you back or not when he supposed too or give a damn how your doing

He has been very good to me. I have extensive  urology needs. His bed side manor always helps me through. I actually enjoy seeing him even under less then enjoyable physical experiences at the time. Plus he is a good Dr. I feel.

Dr. Kuntze is absolutely not the doctor you have been looking for. He makes you feel uncomfortable, has a terrible bedside manner and is extremely dismissive. After my third visit I was fed up, he dismissed me unexpectedly, turned his back and walked away. Seeing him feels like being in a Chinese restaurant where they want you in and out as soon as possible, he should be ashamed of himself. Worst medical experience I have ever had

Wilder Floral Co.
Excellent selection and great customer service. They have a good eye for design and while their price points are a little high, their unique and beautiful work will make giving an arrangement a memorable experience.

For one thing I work there, but the real reason I like this florist is because she makes some really beautiful bouquets. Not inexpensive by any means, but we'll worth the money. And of course they have a really great delivery guy.

They always make the most beautiful floral creations!

Hello,
We recently ordered flowers for my uncle's memorial service and we were delighted with the flowers, the delivery, friendly service and going above and beyond normal customer satisfaction.  We are in Colorado and ordering flowers out of state is sometimes a bit of a challenge.  The young woman who took the order was very pleasant, helpful, and eager to please.  They also texted the delivery time and a photo of the arrangement to us - very nice!  I doubt that we will have an opportunity to follow up with any additional purchases but we hope those who read this will do so for us.  They will not be disappointed.   Thank you!  A pleasure to work with you in extending our family condolences from so far away!

Stopped into Wilder to pick up a bouquet for my future sister-in-laws bridal party. The talented Asha quickly threw together the most gorgeous and unique arrangement of flowers I had ever seen. My sister and all the party guests kept complimenting them. I would recommend this place for anyone needing everyday floral arrangements or for events.

Best Buy
We got help right away.  Associate was friendly and knowledgeable.  He made thoughtful recommendations based on our needs which he assessed by asking questions.  Additionally, because one of our purchases was a television, he recommended we take the time to sign up for the Best Buy credit card in order to get some signification rewards.

Tried getting a hold of some fools at your store and ended up being put on hold for 25 min easy. Ended up calling corporate to get my stuff figured. SMH.

The BEST Best Buy around!  Amazing service from all staff and if there is something sales staff can't do for you managers are right there to help!  Not something you always get at big box stores!

Two separate days at two different times we tried to buy a new Samsung phone. Both days there was only 1 person working in their mobile area with several customers waiting. When asked, both times, if he was the only one working in this area, we were told the coworker was at lunch. We chose to buy elsewhere.

Always helpful at best buy. Need more staff members at check out the wait can get long.

Everyone is very polite, hospitable, and always are professional and helpful.  The best and everyone does a good job.  Thank you so much GOD BLESS!

I couldn't have asked for a more accommodating dental experience. Dr. Sayre-Carstairs is very gentle, in fact even the day after I felt great. She's totally restored my confidence in dentists.

I have been coming to Central Coast and Dr. Sayer for years and years . Chances are if I hadn't found them I probably wouldn't have all my teeth now. Thank goodness for Dr. Sayer.

As someone who has a fear of dentists, it really matters to me that the doc i s gentle and all her staff are the same!

This place is great! Always something new.

Not a good experience.  Found a set of two pictures that had been marked down except that the glass on one of the pictures was cracked.  They would not mark it down anymore.  To replace the glass would have been very expensive and the were not willing to mark it down anymore

It's a nice place to look for a new things for the house

Sprint Store
Initially they did a good job and were helpful. However I have been waiting close to a month for them to get me my phone and no, zero, zip - follow up from them on when they are going to get me the phone.  I have been in 3 times, called 5 times and each time they give me the run-around. Still no phone.... sad!

My experience was not good. We had got the runaround trying to get my daughter an iphone 7. It was awful. We had went to 3 stores and this 3rd store was the worst. Poor customer service, rude and condescending employees. The manager wouldn't even help. Was busy on his cell phone. No customers around of course, just on his phone. Nice.

Les and Adrian were not only very kind and patient, but also incredibly knowledgeable.  When you need technical support, you must have individuals who really know what they are doing. These guys are terrific.  If you want to be educated,  see them.  Also, my service with Sprint is superb, so in all, I feel like I won today.  Great people.

Edwin and Nick did a great helping me recover my contacts from my gmail account. Great service

Very helpful staff. Casey initially greeted me and answered questions without making me feel pressured to buy. After walking around and contemplating what it is I wanted, Les approached me and helped me with everything I needed. Definitely recommend this store. Super helpful and knowledgeable. Thanks guys.

Acropolis
Chad designed our lighting for our new build. I had no idea what a difference quality lights with the right placement would make. The lighting is the highlight of our house! These guys are amazing to work with and definitely know their stuff! I highly recommend them if you want your lighting to look good.

So very helpful, accommodating, knowledgeable and pleasant. The assortment of lighting is the best. Love the floor lamp we purchased. We will shop there again!

We walked in to Acropolis seeking help for light fixtures that we had purchased elsewhere. Our electrician recommended Acropolis and told us that they would be able to do the small re-wiring job. When we called we spoke with a friendly guy who told us to bring in the fixtures and they would take a look. Great! However, when we arrived, we were greeted by Chad who was busy helping another customer. No problem! When Chad was finished with the other customer we expected to be helped out with a friendly smile and also expected to be spoken to with respect, asked questions about our project (which happens to be a $200k remodel) and shown other light fixtures which we might need (we need a ton!). Bottom line is that Chad is not friendly, not helpful and like another review on YP says, "Acropolis chooses its customers". I guess we didn't fit the bill. My wife, son and myself all felt very uncomfortable the entire time. We purchased a 20' piece of wire for $60.00 (ripoff) and I have re-wired the fixtures myself. 

I gave the company 3 stars as opposed to 1 because the selection is terrific and I assume that not all of the people who work here are as entitled and childish as Chad. Sorry buddy, but I have started a business from scratch and run said business for over a decade and I know how to treat people, especially my customers, who help me pay my bills.

I don't usually write negative reviews as I would hate to deter people from a business that might have made a mistake with one situation or another, but after leaving this place, my family and I felt unaccomplished and we even argued about the lighting situation. Thanks Chad.

Their selection is ridiculously good. We got introduced to them at a local business trade-show/exhibit. If you are looking for contemporary and modern ideas for indoors or outdoors, this is the place. I'm surprised they have this much selection on the central coast. GREAT find. The son of the owner is a "Macgyver" type that will work with you to do anything unique and creative. Check them out. "Tell them the Magician sent you."

Great help for my wife and I when we were ahopping for a chandelier recently. Chad also makes a killer magnetic mount battery operated BBQ light that is top quality. She purchased  the chandelier and I the BBQ light. We were both happy-thanks Chad!

Costco Wholesale
I love shopping at Costco. And for that reason I try to limit my trips. I always over spend then have a problem with finding a place for everything. They have most of the stuff I need at pretty good prices. I love their meats and stock up when I'm there. I got there at the height of the food sampling so it was a little crowded but was able to get around OK. Check out was not too bad either.

I went to Costco to get a 12 pack of tamales that averaged in price to a dollar and a quarter.  They had pork, cheese, and chicken.  I wanted shredded beef but apparently they don't carry it.  I settled for the chicken.  While there I had my glasses adjusted and cleaned by a very nice lady.  My experience until then had been pleasant.  Being disabled, I was using the shopping cart to brace myself.  I had only the package of tamales.  On my way out the exit, the checker looked at what I had in the cart and with a little smirk said "you should have gotten a bigger cart".  She dashed my pleasant experience at Costco and for the remainder of the afternoon.

Great place to purchase items for a medium sized family. Fairly cheap prices makes me keep coming back. Other than that it does have very long checkout lines and no self checkout. Which means no quick shopping runs, it's all or nothing.

Love Costco. Pharmacies great too. Their medication is better quality than most places and they are honest. Hard to find in many places.  The store carries items at such better prices than regular stores and carries a great organic selection. Plus the samples are great. You can get ideas from workers and taste what you are buying b4 you buy it. So refreshing. Its definitely a one stop shop .

This is one of the Best Costco locations I have shopped at. The Gasoline lines move rather quickly and the parking is always open and available. I usually arrive around 9:40 A.M. to fuel up and then I am one of the first customers when the front doors open. The store layout and lighting are great with several associates working to help you. The prices and selections are very competitive, and the Samples in the later hours are a great opportunity to see if you like or dislike a product. The checkout process moves along quickly and I enjoy chatting with the associates who always offer me Boxes for my items and help out if needed. I am very thankful to have this location and look forward to checking out the New Costco location coming soon in Santa Maria.

5 Star Electric
Showed up on time.  Courteous technician.  Fixed light fixture in no time.  prices reasonable.

Bruce and his technician were extremely helpful, professional and reliable with our electrical needs in our residence.  We highly recommend his services as it was a pleasure to work with 5 Star Electric.

I will definitely use 5 Star again. The employees are knowledgeable, professional, and efficient. They completed the job on time and the place looks great!  I highly recommend this company.

Called them on an emergency job where we were under the impression that their was a severed connection between the pole and the home. 5 Star electric walked us through the protocol and was able to get to the home on a very busy stormy Friday. It was a pleasure working with such a professional and the electronic invoicing is really convenient.

Tom Caffery with 5 Star quickly diagnosed the problem quickly and made all repairs efficiently and in a workman like manner.  I was fully satisfied with his work and the charges were fair.  I would recommend this firm.

Gilman W Carr Inc
Highly Recommended!

I'm a big baby when it comes to going to the dentist. Dr. Carr (and assistant) did a very good job at making sure I was ok. The staff are very professional and friendly. I had a pleasant and pain free experience.

Dr. Carr is beyond just a dentist.  He is an outstanding human being who really CARES for his patients.  He has gone over and above for me, in helping me resolve the facial pain I've had.  I have so much respect and trust for this wonderful dentist, I would recommend anyone looking for a kind and gentle dentist who actually listens to you, please don't hesitate to call Dr. Carr's office.  You won't regret it.  I am so glad to have found him.  Thanks, Dr. Carr for everything.

well, tell it like it is. the staff is oh so friendly,  the doc is so nice, convivial, and good at his job. my wife had a root canal, and one might think she just had a small filling. I am with her following this event, and if ever there was painless dentistry,  this is about as close as one could get, thank you sincerely, oh so sincerely.

Dr. Carr was very pleasant, knows his profession and gives great service.  I am a difficult patient and afraid of dental work.  He and his assistant were very nice, patient and kind.  When he gives you a shot you don't feel it!!!  Best shot giving dentist I ever had and I have had lots of work done as I was in a car accident at 16 and ever since that I have had trouble with my bridge and other teeth.

I request him when I need root canal work when my dentist suggests someone different.  Expensive.... YES.... but they ALL ARE.

Great customer service, they are friendly and helpful. I would like for them to start providing the big bags so I can keep my purchases together and clean.

Great place.
Opened a register when more people where in line..
Very helpful with app to get twenty percent off.

Very helpful staff. They were able to answer all our questions completely. Very good discount structure.

I was looking for a particular item. The sales associate went out of his way to check the back, bring up that sort of item on his computer screen and was very helpful with information. I worked retail for years and know great customer service when I see it. This guy had it.

Good customer service, very helpful employees. Nice selection for the home.

Palm Dental Care
I travel 25 miles to visit Dr Leroux!  He is one of the best for sure!  His staff is uber friendly and always so helpful!  All my expectations have been exceeded!  Peggy is amazing and so accommodating! He gives great shots too. Totally painless.

This is the only dentist I trust in San Luis Obispo. They are friendly and knowledgeable. They get me in and out of the office promptly and there is little to no wait at you appointment. I appreciate their conservative approach to dentistry and I have never felt pressure to have any work done. I feel they genuinely care about my well being and have my best interest in mind. This is the only dentist in the area that kept me coming back after the second visit.

This is the best dental office and staff I have ever used. Dr. Leroux and his entire staff are friendly, professional and make the whole experience wonderful. I can not say enough about them.

Palm Dental Care really changed the way I view going to the dentist. After neglecting to go for quite some time, I made an appointment. I couldn't of asked for a better experience. All previous anxiety quickly disappeared. Peggy at the front desk is very warm and motherly, and instantly made me feel comfortable. Dr. Leroux and his assistant's really did amazing work and went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable throughout the process of my visits. I will definitely be recommending Palm Dental.

I love everyone at Palm Dental. I never thought i would loose my fear of going to the dentist, but with all of their help I have. Thank you!!!!

Boxes & Batteries
Always very helpful and has what I need!

This is a great place to get batteries. Any kind of battery you can imagine and the owner is incredible and provides excellent customer service. I have been there several times and he has had everything I needed, in stock, and always looks for discounts or coupons to save me money. Very much appreciate his great customer service.

Horrible service and bad phone customer service ethic it seems like the individual is rushing you out the call

After a mechanic tried to sell me a new battery and alternator for a 1980 Porsche 911, Batteries Plus checked out the battery for free and referred me to German Auto for additional testing. These two businesses saved me over $700 in unnecessary work!

As it turns out, both the battery and alternator were fine! I  was happy to pay German Auto (Pacific St, SLO) the $70 for the diagnostics time. And the gentlemen at Batteries Plus are a pleasure to deal with. Great prices and honest people, it doesn't get much better than that.

When it comes to batteries, they have it all. Jeff does a great job.

Lombards Stereo
Best in the business. If your looking to build a quality audio system, these guys have the best quality speakers from manufacturers that don't distribute outside of their respective countries. All of the staff are exceptionally knowledgeable and aren't afraid to tell you when you're waisting money. (E.g. $1000 alpine vs $300 maestro)

Love these guys.  Been dealing with them for years and they have always stood by their work, fair prices and give you honest answers to your questions.  I'll be dropping my wife's car off on Wed to get worked on.  Angel is a great guy.

These guys were great. I wasn't in the market for anything super pricy, as I am only sixteen and paying for this my self. However, unlike all other stores, I didn't feel rushed through. At other places they tried to get rid of me when I told them my budget. 

These guys on the other hand were friendly, respectful, and didn't try to work me past my budget. They have good prices, and they didn't try to sell me something I didn't need. 

Anyway, I purchased my stereo, and installed it myself, when I had questions, I called and they were able to answer them in perfect detail over the phone. Very patient, and helpful. 

I came back in after realizing one of my speakers wasn't working. They took off my door panel, and found the problem in just a couple minutes, they had the parts needed on hand, and fixed it in about 30 minutes total, very reasonable cost for labor as well. 

Overall I give them a five out of five. Excellent service, and because they are a premium dealer for a lot of brands, they over really good warranty coverage. 

Thanks guys!

-Luke

Poor service and even worse quality for a simple job

I had a new stereo receiver put into my car. It took about 4 hours total, and as far as I can tell everything works great. They are an official dealer for Alpine, which comes with some perks if you buy into that brand of stereo. These include service, and an extended warranty. 

I would be lying if I said the prices here are cheap; but they are for the most part fair. I got the base level Alpine CDE-151 receiver for $150, which is exactly what Alpine sells them for online, however you can get the same model on amazon for ~$90. I ended up paying about $60 in other parts required for installation (dash kit, wire harness, and antenna adapter), and $90 for labor. There was also a $7 miscellaneous charge which I am unsure of the cause. 

As far as customer service goes, 10/10. The owner, David, showed me all the different options and explained the strengths and weaknesses of each unit to help me decide what I was looking for. There was never any pressure to buy more expensive models, which I really appreciate. He and his staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.

Lloyd Marcum DDS, Inc.
Dr. Marcum said I absolutely needed a root canal.  I was looking at the same image of my tooth he was and it seemed very obvious that a skilled dentist could fix it. I left his office, went to another dentist, and he fixed my tooth with no problem.  Here I am three years later with no problem from that tooth.  It is my opinion that Marcum puts his own financial interests above the interests of his patients.  I believe he ignores the facts so that he can line his pockets.  I woke up this morning much earlier than I should have because I am sincerely worried about anyone less intelligent that I am, who is referred to this man's office.  I believe he pays Dr. Daniels, who is a very nearby dentist, for referrals of patients who do not actually need root canals.

I was scared about pain, they catered to my cowardice and I really didn't feel a thing., even after the Local Anastasia wore off. Thank you Dr. And your staff was sweet.

I went to my dentist for a routine cleaning and found out I would probably need a root canal.  I was referred to Dr. Marcum and can't be happier!  I was able to be screened right away and my root canal was scheduled promptly.  Dr. Marcum and his staff are wonderful and I felt at ease with the procedure. If you need a root canal I highly recommend Dr. Marcum!!


Best experience I ever had with a root canal.
Dr. Marcum started exactly on time.
Dental assistant explained each step so I knew what to expect.
The whole proceedure only took one visit ( about an hour) and no follow up visit.
Very professional and efficient operation.

I had a root canal at this man's office. Turns out, I never needed it and I think he was in collusion with the dentists next door. Please, please, please get a second opinion before you let this man ruin your mouth and cost you thousands.

Mission Family Dental
Great dentist and staff. Thank you for your services

I am new to the area and was looking for a new dentist. I went to Mission Family Dental and was very happy I did. This was the best experience I have ever had.  The office staff was very professional and very knowledgeable.  I have found my dentist. I will never go anywhere else. I highly recommend Mission Family Dental to anyone looking for a new dentist.

I absolutely admire and adore the people at Mission Family Dental! Very professional punctual and courteous. The prices are good even lower than other dentists in town the work is impeccable! The dentist wears magnifying loupe or he can see just as a jeweler because I didn't come pearly whites for nothing! And I speak Spanish and English go give them a try you will not be disappointed

These were the nicest ladies and dentist ever. They saw my fear of dentists and did everything in their control to make me feel at ease. They took away the pain and were wonderful in doing so. If you hate the dentist then this is the place to turn your fear into a place to get your teeth taken care of. Thank you ladies. 

Good luck with this office.  Was assigned to this office by my Delta HMO plan and was accepted in May by them.  Could not get a first appointment until July - when my husband and I showed up for our July appointments - they said they had no info on us or our appointments and were no longer taking HMO patients (odd, since our plan shows they accepted us as patients in May and included us in the capitation payments to this office).  Said they would call us back to schedule something, never got call back.  When I called them back, they pretty much refused to set up an appointment for us and told us to go elsewhere.  My suggestion ---- everyone should go elsewhere!

Pacific Eye
I couldn't say enough good things about Pacific Eye.  I had Lasik surgery, and was driving and back at work the NEXT DAY!  I started out with 20/200 vision (obviously I couldn't survive without glasses), and ended up with 20/15, without glasses, in 24 hours! Dr. Higginbotham was absolutely wonderful!  He was knowledgeable, polite, understanding, and patient.  Lura walked me through the whole process, answering all my questions (I had lots!), and never once was annoyed or pushed me off.  The clinic is a great place, too, with state-of-the-art equipment.  I never had too long of a wait, and was overall VERY pleased with my experience.

I have never had a better overall medical experience...and in 70 years I've had a few doctor visits. Dr Hulburd is not only an excellent physician, he really enjoys what he does and improving people's vision.I had successful cataract surgery on both eyes.

But it takes more than doctors to make a successful practice. All the staff are pleasant, knowledgeable and caring... I've been to the SLO and Paso offices. They clearly treat patients the  way they would wish to be treated.

I always have a pleasant experience when I visit their office. No long waits and they are very friendly.

The care from start to finish is excellent. I have moved from Arroyo Grande to Oregon, but I returned here for eye care because I trust their excellence from Dr Amir and the people who help him to the lovely ladies in the optical shop. They are very very helpful always.  There is a great selection of glasses.

I have been going to Pacific Eye for the past five years and have had excellent care from the doctors and staff.  I've recommended them to several friends. They are extremely professional and thorough.

Love love love!  Such a great little shop to wander in if you are ever on campus.  And they have the most beautiful, most reasonably priced arrangements with free delivery on campus.  I have always had the best service when calling to send an arrangement to my Mustang daughter.  The Shop personnel have given me great advice on arrangements/planters based on what looks the best in the shop on that particular day.

poly plant variety

I Love the Plant Shop! There is an abundance of new things every time I go in and the prices are affordable for everyone!

Got my girlfriend flowers from here a couple of times now. They do a great job helping me match flowers to her personality and the prices are hard to beat.

Pro Builders
My bathroom and kitchen remodels were both done by Pro builders of San Luis Obispo.  The kitchen remodel was done very well.  The bathroom remodel was also very nice!  Both the kitchen and bathroom are the best they have ever looked!

I used Manny to do both my kitchen and bathroom remodels about a year ago, and just wanted to show my support by writing a review.

I completely recommend Pro Builders of San Luis Obispo for anyone in SLO County who is looking for a bathroom remodel or kitchen remodel.  They also do new construction and additions, but my only experience with them is the kitchen and bathroom remodel so that is what I am recommending that they do for you.

Thanks Pro Builders!

Good doctor, but horrible office organization.  Main office only open 6 hours a week.  Tried to drop off paperwork during posted office hours, and office closed.  This also happened to my husband a year ago.  Staff and physician not at all disturbed by having to make second 50 mile roundtrip to drop off paperwork!

Go here if you crack your phone screen they will have it done in a jiffy. Also any charger adapter or dongel that you can imagine, they have overall great place could use some longer hours but otherwise perfect.

Had what I needed for my computer, or atleast something to make it work. The gentleman working helped me immediately as I walked in the door.

Its a great place to find those "hard to find" electronic needs

WE ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS, Despite what Google thinks!

Moved to San Luis Obispo.

Dr. John A. Freeman, DDS
My daughters teeth look awesome and I was impressed with such a thorough job Dr. Freeman did on my daughters braces. She gets TONS of compliments on her smile now and I was impressed with the attention to detail and followup Dr. Freeman does for his patients.  I would highly recommend him!

Dr. Freeman does amazing work and is an all around genuine, warm and welcoming health professional! He listened to all my concerns and worked with my budget! He has his own new and innovative ideas and was able to move several of my teeth that had migrated since the loss of my Holly retainer. I was super happy with my results and the extremely reasonable cost of his treatment, compared to what other orthodontists had quoted me. I highly recommend at least getting into his office and having a consultation with him, you won't regret it!

As a teen I got braces through Dr.Freeman with the hopes of permanently making my mouth better..straight teeth & to correct my "over bite"(front teeth not meeting when I bite). Now that some years have gone by, I've noticed that Dr.Freeman did not complete the treatment. I was not given a retainer to keep my teeth straight after the removal of the braces. He left a wire across the back of my front teeth on the bottom, which I ended up snipping out myself. Super disappointed that my folks had to come up with $4,000 only to create bigger problems with my teeth later on in life. I would have been better off without getting braces. It's a joke.

I have always hated my crooked teeth.  I resented not having them straightened when I was a kid because I thought I missed my chance.  Doc Freeman hooked me up...and now I love my teeth.

SLO Smiles
I have been a patient at SLO Smiles for many years and my experiences have always been enjoyable.  Maria, my hygienist, is kind, knowledgable, thorough and gentle! I always look forward to my teeth cleaning because I know I will get the most up to date treatment with the latest technology.  And the office staff is friendly and make you feel welcome.  I highly recommend SLO Smiles!

SLO Smiles has changed my life. I have been deathly afraid to go to the dentist for over 20 years. I only went when I was in severe pain. Not anymore! Dr. Murphy put me at ease on my first visit and I've been back every 6 months since. He works quickly, yet is very thorough. I'm always surprised by how fast my appointments go. I know I won't ever have any more issues with my teeth with Dr. Murphy!  EVERYONE in the office is so friendly. Cambria, my hygienist, is the best! She gets me in and out for my cleanings with ease. I actually look forward to my appointments now because of the professionals in this office. I can't say enough good things about this practice. They are hands down the best dental practice around.

This place is the best I‚Äôve found in the SLO area. I‚Äôve spent my fair share of time in a dentist chair due to my genes, I can speak from experience. Wonderful staff and the most lovely hygienist, she sings while she works, as I‚Äôm a music therapist I find this a delightful gift. The office overall makes obvious steps to educate their patients to have the right habits and ultimately need them less.

I have been to several dentists over the years, and Dr. Murphy, Main & Leopold are the BEST dentistry group I have had the pleasure to use!  Their front office staff is polite, efficient & friendly. The back office staff was also wonderful!  They were friendly, fun, &excellent at their jobs. The dentists are top notch, with state of the art equipment, and appointments that run right on time.  They have enough dentists to cover each other and are small enough to be just the right size!   I would highly recommend this group!

I have thoroughly enjoyed being a patient of Dr. Ian Leopold. He is compassionate , professional, and really cares about providing the best dental experience  for his patients!
His hygienists are very considerate and sweet. 
The office staff are also very friendly ,from the moment you enter the office till the moment you leave. They make going to the dentist easy!

Open Air Flowers
Great long lasting contemporary flowers. Really sweet & helpful staff. They can tailor anything to fit your needs for your occasion. 

Best flower shop around! Always have great arrangements, my Wife loves them!

They didn't want to do business with me because they thought the way I read my credit card number over the phone was too monotonic.  Said my voice was not ordinary and disconcerting.  I was left puzzled after she hung up on me and actually felt quite discriminated against.

Welcome to SLO, California.

Better to call 1-800-Flowers

Thanks Open Air Flowers for helping my son out last weekend for Prom.
He had ordered flowers from Wilder Floral in San Luis Obispo and was supposed to pick them up at 2:30 for Prom that night. When he went to pick them up they told him they didn't have time to make them and gave him his money back. In a panic he called Open Air and you bent over backwards to make him a corsage for that night. 
I can't thank you enough. Everytime I need flowers now I know where to bring my business!

Quality flowers but expensive

Sprigs Floral Designs
I have had the pleasure of working with Erin and her husband to deliver the most beautiful arrangements to my Mother. They are the bees-knees of kindness and always give the most gorgeous flowers. But what makes them unique is they have a warm heart and it goes beyond the flowers. Thank you for taking care of my Mom.

A

Erin at Sprigs handled our daughters wedding and was absolutely amazing from her gorgeous floral designs to the inventive ways to help us economize without sacrificing the beauty of her florals. Thank you so so much!!!

The most beautiful flower arrangements you could ask for!

Erin is awesome in every way, helping guide her clients to beautiful, thoughtful floral gifts. I will count on her expertise for all my floral needs.üëç

Corinne went above and beyond with not only floral but centerpiece and d√©cor. Her expert advice and tips helped tremendously throughout the entire planning process. I was able to sit back, relax, and be worry free the day of my wedding because I knew leaving the d√©cor in her hands was perfectly fine and it turned out BETTER than what I imagined. Not only were the flowers breathtaking but she was very affordable and cost effective with our budget.

Wheeler-Smith Mortuary
I can't say enough wonderful things about the caring services I received at Wheeler-Smith.  Sandra was courteous and kind to me on my initial call, which was hard for me when my Father first passed. She was gentle and considerate of the delicate nature of my situation and did everything she could to make the process as smooth and easy as could be.  She accommodated our meeting with less than 24 hours notice, was prepared and explained everything in a straight forward and non-pushy way.  Their selection of products was far more extensive than I had expected and they absolutely did what they said they would do.  I am so happy I chose them and would highly recommend them to any of my friends in the future.  I know I made the right choice and I am grateful they are a part of our community here in San Luis Obispo.

Their staff is respectful, caring, and very helpful especially in a time of need. Sandy is wonderful.  They provide services we thought we would have to take care of.  It is great to know there is a local business owner that provides excellent service.  Thank you! The Bakers

Dollar Tree
Interesting variety of items. Check out can take awhile as they are often short staffed.

I come here all the time. It is a decent-sized Dollar Tree location with a pretty good selection. There is no fresh produce section and the food is limited to just two aisles. Santa Maria has a Dollar Tree that is like the size of a supermarket and this is not like that. It is a normal size Dollar Tree not a small one. The one over at the marigold Center is half the size. The people who work here are very nice and friendly and helpful. The stock is kept up in the store is clean. San Luis Obispo has a very nice group of folks in general living in it so this Dollar Tree is a very pleasant experience to go to.

Always find what I need here and more. can't beat the prise. I frequently go to the Madona plaza Dollar tree it have refrigerated foods.i.donate to the troops when I can.

Every thing here is a dollar which is really nice, and there know selling VR's there now it is just the best place to go to!!

Nice staff, huge store including some fresh produce. Questionable how fresh though...

========================================================
Shell
Small Shell station with most general things you might need.  Bathroom is often pretty disgusting but it's a gas station bathroom.

Exelen service to all costumer s

Central Coast Gymnastics Sports Center, Inc.
The experience here has been great!  The kids are happy and love the coaches.

I have been a gymnast here for 12 years, competing all the way from Level 4 to Level 10 competitive boys team gymnastics. I received a lifetime of experiences and memories in this gym. Highly recommended, staff well trained, office professional and overall a happy place to be--Let's go CCG.

I've been here once. I feel like the bad reviews are unwarranted. A mistake or one bad employee doesn't constitute a 1 star. Let's not forget that mistakes happen. I'll be enrolling my boys this month. I've heard lots of good things about this place.

Love this place! My kid has been going to CCG for 8 months. The coaches are great! Overall gymnastics is a great activity for children, and there's no other place I'd want my son to go. 

Unprofessional and inexperienced coaches. Problems with the office staff from the beginning. Wouldn't recommend this gym to anyone.

Hayward Lumber
Great selection of hardware. Before I went to this place I usually had to special order at other stores. 

Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Pro grade supplies. 

Talk about poor customer service, This would be my second time walking into San Luis Obispo Haywards for a quote, the first time  was for windows that no one could seem to respond too, sorry, Haywards lost out on a expensive job and now I couldn't even get a single associate to acknowledge me because of there own conversation about Saint Patrick's day, I'm sure my 600sqft deck from the ground up isn't worth the time or money, but I have to say that I've been burned for the last time.

So its back to HOME DEPOT!

Very helpful very friendly. They were very prompt and always quick and perfect with our orders.

My son loves this place! I have always been happy with them, and my wife loves the online check-in, but we keep coming back because of how they are with my 2yr old son.

The people who work here seem to really not like their job. Bad service but I guess that‚Äôs what you get for a 10$ haircut

Kaleo very experienced! Excellent results! Mahalo

They do a good job for the price. If you sign up for an account with them they give your phone number to telemarketers.

Call ahead/online is great that works as advertised, unlike some other major haircut chains where they still put you at the back of the queue.

MZR Fitness
Starting training with MZR fitness has been the best decision, regarding health and fitness I have ever made!   Mike's  knowledge and expertise  is priceless. BEST IN SLO

MZR Fitness is the place to be. Just down the street from in San Luis Obispo. If you want to get a great work out, be around fun people, and be in a great atmosphere, MZR Fitness is for you. The owner, Mike Robinson provides and creates fun and challenging workouts that fit my and your needs and goals. Not only does he design the workout for you, but his encouragement and motivation helps you want to take to that victory lap. My workouts with Mike have been such a help! I'd recommend MZR Fitness and Mike Robinson to anyone! I'll be sticking around, that's for sure!‚Äé



MZR Fitness Facility is packed full of new, innovative work out equipment that makes getting in shape exciting.

For the past couple of years, Mike has helped me maintain a consistent workout routine as well as a healthy lifestyle. At MZR Fitness, my workouts are more effective then ever in a new, friendly, and clean environment. Mike constantly challenges me with new and creative exercises which makes training even more fun.

Thanks Mike, and congrats on the new gym, it rocks!


MZR Fitness is a new and unique kind of gym that really makes working out a lot of fun for me. I really enjoy the different workout equipment and workouts that Mike has had me do so far. The friendly personal attention that I get here is great, and is one of the reasons why I choose MZR Fitness over the other gyms around town.

I've been working out at MZR Fitness for almost 4 months now and I absolutely love it. I promised them at MZR Fitness that when I hit my short term goal of losing 20 lbs, that I would write a review online for them so I here I am because I just hit my target yesterday. As cliche' as it sounds to say this, it really is the truth that I could not have done it without the help of MZR Fitness. These guys there really know their stuff especially Mike. I've just never been around so much positive & motivating energy in a gym before. They held me accountable every step of the way and I just love coming there and I look forward to it every single workout. 

And lastly, I debated on whether I should address one of the previously posted messages by "sportymeg5 " but I can't help it and I have to say something. All that I'm going to say is that I think that whomever this person was should keep their negative comments to themselves. If you don't have anything nice to say, then dont say anything. Furthermore, it makes me believe that it was one of the other gyms here in town that wrote that message or just somebody who doesn't know exactly what is going on at this gym. 

So yes when you say that you "wouldn't go back", you really are doing everybody a favor. Everyone that I know who goes to MZR Fitness loves it and we don't want that kind of negativity on the premises.

5 minutes before midnight on Friday and Saturday it's the best sight to see and only place in the neighborhood still open! Smokes, drinks and eats to keep the party going!

Love the shell brand, it is the only gasoline I'll put in my cars.

It's a gas station

Great Service and Knowledgeable directions. The attendant says they are under new management and improving everything from Customer Service to a makeover of Car Wash and soon to be new pumps! :)

A clean station. But damn. $3.39 a gallon! Expensive!

========================================================
CrossFit Inferno
The gym is located in a tucked away corner off a main street.  It's a good size including one gym for the regular members and one gym for the competition team and olympic lifting.  The front office is quaint and the lounge is kid friendly with plenty seats to hang out in while waiting to get into a class.

Bill Grundler, the owner, is attentive to all the athletes and we were no different.  He made sure we felt welcomed and during the workout we performed all our movements correctly. 

One tip.  Some of the members we encountered were a little stand off-ish at first, but once we broke through the tough exterior, then they were ok.  If you're in the area though, this would a place to drop in.

Love this place... great coaching, great atmosphere

My favorite place in the whole world!! Highly recommend.

I have been a member of the Inferno for a little over a year now and my absolute favorite part of the experince has been the trainers and members.  I often find that I don't want to go home after the workout and end up staying talking to all of my new friends!  Everyone has been open and welcoming, the trainers are skilled and passionate, and the classes are second to none. 

Everyone participates in the trainer led workouts - young, old, albe, not so able.  Loads and movements are appropriately scaled and/or modified so that everyone does a very similar workout.  The workouts themselves are constantly varied so there is never a sense of burning out on a particular routine, because we don't have one!

It seems like every day someone bests a previous record, experiences a 'first', or just plain does something they never thought possible.  

A truly amazing community, and an truly amazing workout. 
You'll leave with a tired body, energized mind, and the desire to do it all over again tomorrow!  

========================================================
Relax The Back
I love my cervical pillow. The French woman who assisted me in the store was very busy but she handled all the work coming at her at the same time with grace and ease. I am impressed with the cleanliness of the store, the professional service I received and the prompt checkout. My cervical pillow is serving its needs with keeping my neck in alignment while I sleep. I highly recommend Relax The Back.

Beware of buying an office chair at this store. They are overpriced and uncomfortable. If you purchase one which is "custom" rather than "stock" (meaning it's a different color than black) and it doesn't work for you because the seat is lumpy, this store will not refund your money or give you store credit.

The worst customer service in the San Luis Obispo store. I have dealt with 3 persons now. The help does not understand its product warranties. The help does not understand how to refund charges. The help does not communicate with one another.  Because of these issues I am returning the product as I can only presume what it would be like if the product I purchased had problems. Beward - buy from another franchise.

Dominique and Justin gave my mom and me excellent service.  They listened to her needs, clearly explained the differences in chairs, and provided prompt delivery of a fantastic product that will truly help her back feel better.  These two relaxed salesmen have been nothing but pleasant and helpful, providing wonderful customer service.

I have two Lifeform custom chairs from this chain.  One has lasted over a decade & is still going strong. Both have lifetime warranties & are likely to outlast me!  The chairs are not cheap, but are far better for your back than most people's beds.  Lifeform chairs are made in Canada & has amazing customer service....one call to Canada & they helped me far quicker than even this store.  If you have back pain, there is no other place that sells these types of chairs. Considering that back surgery can easily cost $200k & not fully address one's pain...a chair that costs $2k is a bargain...if it helps....and it sure does!

========================================================
Mitch's Stitches
Awesome, local family owned. Great workmanship and super quick. Replaced a ripped section of a Mercedes leather seats and matched it perfectly. 

They have a good job and you were quick nice nice quality work

Good information and will be back to have car upholstery repair done.

I'm a Santa Barbara local who heard of Mitch's Stitches through word of mouth.  In the past 4-5 years I have had a couple of jobs done by Mitch.  The first was a complete V-berth upolstery project for my 17' boat using high density foam, and sunbrella fabric that just turned out incredibly clean and fit like a glove.  
Most recently Mitch came to the rescue by making a custom, removeable, sunbrella fabric stowage bulkhead for a custom 10' skiff that I have.  He took my original design and made it even better by understanding what my requirements were, and applied his expertise in custom upholstery work to it.  
Both times that I have been in Mitch's Stiches, there has been at least 3-4 projects in the shop from custom Hot Rods, to custom golf carts!  I don't think there is much Mitch can't and or wont be able to do.
For me, Mitch's professional attitude, work ethic, and craftmanship make it worth the drive to San Luis to get the job done right the first time!

========================================================
Spark Yoga
I've been to a lot of yoga studios around the area and there is something special about Spark.  The instructors are fabulous and the ambience really puts me in the right head and heart space to further my practice.  I love it!  Signed up for a membership in this new year.

I had never done yoga before.  I love Spark's variety of classes especially that the first class is 6:15am so I can go before work!  It's a total body work out with Sculpt and Barre and I am stronger because of the wonderful teachers. I've been going for nearly 3 years.  It's clean and I'm so excited about the expansion. Love. Love.

I like being greeted by people who know my name.  When I walk in I feel like a long lost family member who has just returned from a great journey, welcomed home, seen and appreciated.  It means a lot, thanks for creating this!!

Spark is a great little yoga space in SLO.  I like the hour long class lengths, class style variety, and plethora of equipment.  As someone who has been taking wellness classes around SLO for 15 years, and taught them around the community for 10 years, I love what this space is up to and look forward to seeing how they continue to evolve!  Thanks for doing what you do, Spark! Some very specific personal preferences:  The heat gets overwhelming for me sometimes.  The classes can be so fast paced and loud that I can't hear what the next move is and by the time I figure it out the instructor has moved on.  I wouldn't expect the studio to change those things though, they seem to be part of the vibe and most students seem to love those parts of the classes so it's likely just me :)

The most enjoyable experience I have ever had. It hit on all the sense. I will definitely be back on a regular basis!

========================================================
Smiling Dog Yoga
The breadth and depth.  I love the different yoga modalities that I am able to experience in a day.  So, the diversity of styles and teachers is key.  Plus, there is a depth that each teacher brings to their class which is on a level that I had previously not experienced from other yoga classes.  I have learned more about myself and the practices of yoga, breathing, grounded centeredness that all my previous yoga experience prior, which spans like 20 years +.  For this I am truly, deeply grateful!  The experience has open my eyes and my heart to new forms of practice and ways of being that I had not previously considered.  I am inspired to enroll in the Teacher Training program - It's just a matter of when.  My yoga practice returned as a way of dealing with a seriously tragic medical journey.  I had two brain surgeries, followed by a back surgery.  Yoga has allowed my body, heart, and soul to continue recovering and I have regained much of the holistic strength that has been lost...!!!

The classes are great, the instructors are knowledgable and caring, and the space is welcoming regardless of ability/skill level.

 peaceful environment and great kitchen:-)

Wonderful teachers, and the studio is very inviting.

My favorite yoga studio.

Club 24 Inc
this gym is never too crowded and the staff is friendly. Frank, who I presume the owner, is always happy to help and give tips. most reviews on here seem to reflect negatively on the cancellation fees and renovation fees charged November. if you read the contract this is all outlined! people leaving bad ratings because they are too dull to read a contract they sign whilst signing up for the gym.

I work out here almost every day. I would give it 5 stars, but they don't have a deadlift platform and bumper plates aren't quite the same.

I have had the best experience with Club 24. This the the first time a gym has felt like a community to me and actually motivated me to go. The trainers and staff are wonderful and take the time to learn your name and help you if a machine is confusing or you are doing a movement in a way that could get your hurt, even if you don't go for personal training!

The remodel is all state of the art equipment and the whole gym looks chic and modern for a very reasonable monthly price. It also pretty amazing that you can take all the classes on just a regular membership! I'm recommend this gym to people all the time!

I called Club 24 today 8/13 1:30pm) and I asked if I could buy a membership so that I could come and take showers for a couple of days. My Father is in Hospice and I've been staying with him 24 hours a day.  I asked if I could buy day passes. The girl on the phone told me that I could NOT do that because I wasn't going to work out...couldn't make this up if I tried! I asked if they offered a monthly pass (even though my Father might not make it through the night). She told me that it was $99.00, but that she would "get in trouble" for selling me one because I wasn't going to work out. I asked to speak to a Manager and she put me on hold until I finally hung up. This is THE WORST BUSINESS that I have ever encountered. Hopefully this review is read BEFORE you spend a dime at this facility. This is absolutely unconscionable.

I love club 24. The employees are very nice and the gym is always clean. It's never really too crowded to the point where it affects my workout. I have never had to wait for a machine and they are also new as well. Come join.!

Equilibrium Fitness for Women
Have been going to this gym for many years - super friendly staff and instructors!  The cardio classes are great, and everyone is made to feel welcome.

I went to this gym last year but had to drop it because of school. Now that it's summer I'm back at it again! I feel super comfortable while working out, and I never have to stay waiting for the equipments. The classes are definitely great workout and they're fun! Over all the staffs are great :D!

I've been going to Equilibrium for years and have always loved the upbeat and friendly vibe. The classes are great work outs and you can always find an open machine or free weights on the floor. All of the instructors, trainers and staff are very friendly and motivating and will help you reach any goals you have. I've been dealing with an injury for quite a long time and my trainer has helped me modify exercises to accommodate my limitations as well as given me endless support to help me reach my goals. I love going to EQ to get a great workout, but on top of that, I love it because the staff and the regulars are just genuinely happy to see you. It's a fun place to be and that makes workouts a little easier to get through! I never want to move from SLO because I know I'll never find another gym like Equilibrium, it really is a gem!

I was very impressed by this women-only gym in SLO.  I needed a day pass for a workout since I was visiting my son for the weekend.  The staff was friendly and helpful and I could tell the clientele enjoyed being there - lots of laughter and camaraderie.  The pleasant ambiance and equipment selection will bring me back again on another visit.  

I've been going here for years and absolutely love it.  Most of the instructors are great and they keep the tempo quick and upbeat.  The fact that this is a women only gym keeps me coming back because I always feel comfortable with the staff and all the regulars.  It can get a little busy at times when school is in and the place gets flooded with the college girls.  But that only lasts for a short while and before you know it the classes are back to normal.

========================================================
Cost Plus World Market
They have a big variety of itemss at this store from all over the world and this time of year, the store has a great selection of Christmas items.  Also they have a lot of kitchen items, jewelry and so much more.

Love it ! My favorite place to buy gifts. For me, and other people :)

Great. Prices and items that you can,t find any wheir else

Always something wonderful to be found here!

Small but diverse selection of international foods.  Rather pricey, but cheaper than traveling for them or via mail order.  Very nice staff here.  Much of the offerings are overpriced, but otherwise impossible to find in this area.

Cal Deals Furniture & Mattress
We first shopped Cal Deals four years ago when we were looking for a children's bed and dresser.  We had a great experience then and have continued to shop Cal Deals because of that. We recently purchased a new king bed and bedroom set along with our second child's bedroom set. Susan was very patient with us and took the time to talk us through all our options and even made some great suggestions.  Unfortunately we needed to return our king bed (didn't work out well with the layout of our room). Susan helped us out for the whole process and we were able to exchange it for a bed we absolutely love. The whole process was painless and surprisingly enjoyable. Cal Deals has furniture for everyone.

We had an awesome experience at Cal Deals with Susan! She has a great personality and was great to work with! She helped us from the second we walked into the store until the minute we left. She gave us an awesome deal on the couch we have been looking for forever, made sure we knew all our color and fabric options and was super patient with us during our decision making process!! She also hooked us up with a fabric guard to protect our couch from our dogs and accidental spills, and made sure our couch would be shipped to us the next day!! Susan truly rocks and I honestly can't wait to work with her for more furniture in the future! Glad we didn't waste our money and one of those over priced furniture stores...Cal Deals is a hidden gem!!

Susan was great.
She really listened to us.
We are buying a new bedroom set and mattress. 
She is also very helpful in what our needs on quality and price. 
Cal Deals is a wonderful to shop.

Truly an awesome experience! Drove 2 hours to see what they had to offer as well as put "a-face-with-a-name" before committing to the purchase sight-unseen. SOO GLAD we did! Very knowledgeable, polite, patient and AWE-some pricing! Furniture buying experiences are usually very exhausting, but NOT HERE! Trust us when we say, we'll BE BACK for our next purchase. 
Thank you Susan and Virginia!! You R-O-C-K. (Side note: you sell GMG smoker grills and Que-pellets, yea, THAT'S a definite positive selling point for all of us BBQ lovers out there!) 
Great customer service, great prices and BBQ supplies, PER-FECTION! You won't be disappointed. Check them out. :)

Deals are amazing and the delivery and set up team is super polite and  professional. Would recommend anyone looking for quality furniture at a great price. Furnished my two bedroom apartment nearly from scratch with quality goods for well under 3k with delivery and setup.

Paragon Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu San Luis Obispo
I recently visited the area for 2 weeks and trained with Chris at both his Paragon SLO and Atascadero locations. He and his students were very welcoming. His SLO location has a large mat area, boxing ring, heavy bags, weight area, and several changing rooms. Chris's teaching was excellent! I enjoyed his instruction and rolling with numerous talented people.

His Atascadero location is brand-new and connected to a large gym with all kinds of amenities. If you are in either area, I would highly recommend Paragon Jiu Jitsu!

Awesome Jiu Jitsu training going on here!! I'm a woman and found it accepting and comfortable. My husband and I were able to train our butts off during our mini vacation! Chris and Mallory are very kind, their students are inviting, and their gym is clean and roomy. Definitely would visit again!!

I'm a beginner Gracie Jiu Jitsu student from Kansas, was in the area vacationing, and decided to stop in and see what Paragon was all about. Great gym! No egos! Everyone was welcoming, and I had a great time!  

While in SLO visiting the wife's family, Chris at Paragon BJJ was kind enough to allow me to drop in for a class. The warm up, techniques, and rolling sessions were all intense, and a great experience. Each of the guys I practiced/rolled with was inviting and kind, despite that I was the outsider for the day. Chris- you and your students are welcome to visit us near Boston at Kimura BJJ (Tewksbury MA) anytime! Thanks again!

Sweet academy with awesome folks. I popped in while visiting the area, no egos. Just old school jiujitsu.

Central Coast R & R Lock
Very knowledgeable and helpful, fast service, great price. Couldn't have asked for a better experience.

they made the keys i needed, made the quickly and easily, and they work better than the originals. I wonder how they did that? the place has a bazillion keys and they seem to know their stuff, but good

They really know their keys! I was in and out in less than five minutes! He even knew what the keys were for score I told him.

Quality work at reasonable price.  Easy to work with both guys.  Highly recommend.

Our key broke and half of it ended up getting stuck in the locking chamber of the trunk. After numerous attempts and many hours of trying to remove it ourselves, we decided it was time for a locksmith. We went to Central Coast R&R Lock and they were able to remove it! (should've just gone there first). It wasn't easy. It took time, patience and skill to get that key out but they did it...and didn't even charge us! We've been and will continue being loyal patrons of this business. Thank you!

Luna Rustica
Great selection of rustic and Mexican furniture.   We had a custom cabinet made and it's exactly what we wanted at a great price.  Lots of unique accessories for your home. 

The owner was exceptionally nice. We didn't purchase any furniture here, but after being stranded in SLO thanks to a goofup by Enterprise Rent-A-Car next door, he was gracious enough to give us a ride to the airport to the other Enterprise Rent-A-Car location.

Great stuff

Dollar Tree
Fun place. Lots to find. Small gift ideas. Home org materials

This is so much different to grocery shopping in Australia

This is like a mini Dollar Tree. The one that is over off of Madonna is a real size Dollar Tree. If you just need something quick or you live right around there then it's nice to have here, but their stock and selection is pretty Limited. It is a clean location and the people there are very nice.

Your typical dollar store. Organized and clean. 

Smaller store but good

Rave Hair Studio
Heather, RAVE's owner, is one amazing hairstylist! She is a master at hair color and hip to the latest hair styles. I look forward to seeing her every 6-weeks. I highly recommend her and suggest making appointments. She is one popular lady!

How they they be closed  when she just did my hair and boy am I getting compliments!  I have given her name out to two other ladies and they have booked appts. based on what they saw she could do with me.
So NO they are not closed!!!!

Happy customer
Loretta  from Fresno.

I was Heather's first customer 34 years ago.  She is the ONLY person I have allowed to cut my hair since 1979.  She moved from Thousand Oaks to San Luis Obispo about 25 years ago.  I now have a long drive to get my haircut but, it is well worth the drive.  Heather is a very special person.

Open for business across from the Mission, in back of Trio Boutique.Best ever, no more mullets for me (:

Pacific Coast Lumber
Now this is a great lumber yard, very reasonable prices and good cutting grain on most of the wood. Best go here before going to the depot, also I am fairly sure they give student discounts to kids in woodworking electives. Nottomention the very nice selection I mainly go for the walnut and maple but they have many others like Paducah and purple heart.

Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center
You always see the negative reviews of hospitals, but what about the Beautiful life-saving Stories? Sierra Vista Hospital is a hero for my family on many occasions. 8 years ago I almost died of viral meningitis it was Sierra Vista Hospital who properly diagnosed, treated me, and saved my life after another local hospital in a nearby Town diagnosed me as being drunk. When my daughter broke her collarbone we came here. When my son broke his foot we came here. Sierra Vista Hospital takes treating children very seriously and we are always seen quickly. 2 months ago my son almost died from a twisted intestine. Sierra Vista Hospital revived him and sustained his life. They quickly got him transferred to Valley Children's Hospital buy helicopter where he had emergency surgery to remove 2 feet of his intestines. Sierra Vista saved his life and they knew what to do even though they didn't know his diagnosis. With distended bowels they were not able to see what was going on but they knew who to contact. They acted quickly which was so vital because his body had gone septic. Without medical intervention we would have lost him. I also have to give credit to a wonderful woman who I call our guardian angel who is outside the emergency room at the time. She was working for San Luis ambulance and saw that I needed help getting him in. I knew she had quickly evaluated him in her mind and saw how critical he was because she quickly took him to a bed where every staff member in the ER dropped what they were doing to work on him. I cannot say how blessed we are that we came to Sierra Vista. Yesterday my youngest daughter got her finger caught in the hinge of my van door. The tip of her finger was falling off. When we got to Sierra Vista and they saw me holding my daughter wrapped in a towel they got me to a bed in less than a minute. They numbed her hand without putting her out and she fell asleep during the stitches. Sierra Vista Hospital did a wonderful job of stitching her up and handling the situation. They went out of their way to make it easy for me and her. The kindness of the doctors and nurses is unmatchable. Thank you Sierra Vista!

Lot of confusion on part on of the nurse. She seemed overwhelmed. Did not get pain medicine for over an hour after request. The hallway was very noisy. Not a very good  experiences.

I don‚Äôt recommend this hospital  at all!!
I Had the worst experience of my life!!

Waiting in the ER  and I'm  pregnant with contractions and chest pains it's been atleast an hour not even in the maternity   section  yet  I'm sitting in the waiting area.... if your baby üë∂ is coming  don't come to this ER your  baby will be here......

Great hospital everyone just really cared and just wanted to help as much as possible

This is quite possibly the last antique place in SLO CITY that exist. It is a wonderful place that I love to go to. She has got vintage clothes. If you are looking for vintage 501 LEVI jeans this is the place to get them.

Beautiful wares, lovely inspiration and culture of ladies running the store, high quality leather and beautiful fabrics, perfect prices

I found the cutest pair of Frye boots here and the ladies running the store were nice to talk to

Totally in love with this place. Lots of rad, vintage finds and the ladies who run the shop are super sweet. 

What a gem! Unique and authentic objects and shop owners. It's my new favorite!

Kennedy Club Fitness
I love this gym so much. There's an amazing variety of classes focusing on strength, endurance, and/or cardio that can be as challenging or as low key as you want to get out of them. And a lot of them mix in fun too. Instructors who help you achieve your goals. Affordable membership AND really affordable kid care. Showers and locker rooms too! The staff is super friendly and helpful. I didn't think I'd ever be a gym person until I found this one and am so grateful!

Overall it's a great gym. Gene is awesome I would highly recommend getting your membership through him in slo. Only downside is the basketball court floor really needs a cleaning and to be dusted regularly.

This is the cleanest gym ever. Nice people at the front desk. Basketball court, swimming pool etc. All fun activities

I really like the well-rounded aspect of this gym with a pool full workout area and basketball court. They just need bigger flat screen TVs in front of the treadmills and ellipticals

Best workout facility in town! Extremely competent staff and services! A special thanks to the owners and management that run the Kennedy club for making this place what it is. I will definitely be recommending to friends and family. 

========================================================
Slo Athletic
Gym facilities are clean, and the equipment has a newer feel to it.  I liked working out here, and the classes were ok, but they were often cancelled because of lack of attendance.  What really displeased me was cancelling my membership.  I had a year-long contract, and I stayed at the gym for the whole year.  When the contract expired, I thought my membership would end, but it didn't; I was moved to a month-to-month membership.  That was my fault for not reading the fine print on the contract, and I was ok with that.  What really upset me was that in order to end the month-to-month membership, I had to pay a 30 dollar cancellation fee, in addition to one additional month.  So what's my reward for sticking out the year long contract?  A nice 50 dollar charge parting gift.  Thanks.  Why is everyone and their brother out to get your money...?

Has the equipment you need for a basic workout, along with a floor...  As far as a full gym, there is no pool, hot tub, sauna, decent locker rooms.

Idler's Home
Idler's is a great place to shop for furniture .  They have good customer service. They also have great appliances.  I bought my last washer and dryer from Idler's.

Had a good experience shopping for a fridge. The salesperson was friendly, knowledgeable and offered advice without being pushy.

Great customer service! Prices comparable to Home Depot but better selection and service.

Love their bargin scratch & dent appliances in the back room, great discount from retail

Athlon Fitness & Performance
I've been at Athlon for two months now and I've got to say that the trainers are awesome. Everyone on staff is fun to be around, approachable, and most importantly, educated. I've been feeling stronger and better than I have in awhile, and on top of that I can feel old injuries finally starting to heal up. I highly recommend you try Athlon out for yourself!

So I've been going to Athlon for 2 months now and love it.  The trainers are fun people but goal focused.  I love that each work out is challenging and touches on both strength and cardio.  Looking forward to a long future with this gym.  Give it a shot, all levels of fitness are welcomed and embraced.

Athlon, in my opinion, is the ideal gym for people of all different fitness levels. As a professional athlete I can honestly say Athlon and its coaches have provided me with the best environment I have ever worked out in. I entrusted them with my career and have reaped the rewards. I have never been as strong or moved as well as I am now thanks to the coaches at Athlon. My balance, vision and overall coordination have improved by leaps and bounds as well. The knowledge I have gained about how my body works and how to properly take care of it is invaluable. From Ryan, to Cory, to Angela, to Jasmine and Andy, every coach that I have worked with has gone above and beyond to help me reach my goals.

I've been a member at Athlon for over year now and it's hands down the best gym I've ever held a membership at! It has all the equipment I was looking for without all the extra "fluff" you get a bigger fitness clubs. While I haven't taken any of their group training/personal training sessions, from what I've seen the trainers at Athlon are extremely knowledgeable & passionate about helping folks reach their fitness goals. I'd totally recommend this place if you're looking for a great gym in SLO.

The Athlon workouts are great.  Jasmine kicks ass.  I've been going for a few months and feel much healthier (started to sweat less when walking around or dancing, feel stronger, and am generally in a better mood).  The classes are paced well, challenging but not overly so if you're a beginner.  Do it!

lululemon
I am a frequent lulu shopper and knew exactly what I was looking for before entering the store, but if I was not a return customer then I would not have purchased any items from this store. The staff was not helpful what so ever. No one greeted me walking in, no one offered me a fitting room, I had to ask for one to be set up, she didn't even ask my name or change it on the room from the person before me. She never asked how I was doing or if I needed another size. Extremely different experience than I have ever had in any other lululemon store. I would rate their customer service a zero. No one asked what I was looking for or any type of assistance at all. I also watched a man looking for about 30 minutes right next to an associate before she offered to help him. 

New store, with excellent and friendly staff.  

I've never been to one of these stores before they came to SLO, but apparently they offer clothes that are very exercise friendly and breathable but still suitable for a casual work environment.  This way if you bike to work or workout in the middle of the day, you can wear these clothes and still be comfortable.

Love your guys athletic wear, the best.

Noble Outdoor Power Equipment
Disappointing when you purchase a product at this place and they tell you they can no longer service or repair my equipment. Been working in landscape industry for many years and never heard of such a thing. I take my equipment the same day to Jacks repair shop in Santa Maria and they are happy to do the repair and have my business. I've purchased several pieces of equipment through the years at Noble and a loyal customer. That ended today! You might think twice about doing business with this outfit.

They take good care of you.

My pull behind mower just wouldn't run right. Kept dying out & a number of other issues. Noble people picked my mower up & took it back to their shop "to see what they could". After a short period of time my mower was returned & now runs better than new. 
My one & only "knock" is that sometimes there's a bit of a wait on "hold".

Only stock an expensive lawn mower overhaul kit with to many parts which aren't needed. 

They seem to be able to fix anything!  They keep my chainsaw buzzing and even keep my old mower working right.

You are copying the coral girls at First Class in Maryland

My girls loved it! 

I was not very happy with the teachers. They were nice enough, but there was not very much one on one time and almost the entire class was just them showing a routine once and then the kids were on their own. There was also usually at least 15 minutes of warming up. A bit much for 5 years olds. They also sat and talked about nothing for the last 5-10 minutes of the class with the kids. I went for one month and then stopped. I also got charged for an extra class because I didn't give them two weeks notice.

I went for a birthday party for a friend and all the teachers where nice and I've been begging my parents to let me go ever sinceüòúüëç

Love this place

Balance A Pilates Studio
After herniating a disk in my lower lumbar I started taking Pilates.  If I take at least once a week my back does not hurt or reinjure.  Nikole is an excellent Pilates instructor and the studio has a welcoming positive vibe.  Clearly the first reviewer is a competitor or bitter hater.

I wake up every Thursday morning thinking about how good my body is going to feel after I go to class that night. The exercises are tailored to your body size and strength. Nikole is an amazing instructor with a great attitude and an awesome sense of humor. I couldn't be happier with my experience at this studio!

I could not disagree with Jim more!!  I don't usually write reviews, but this was necessary to set the record straight!  I have had amazing results attending the Pilates reformer group classes at Balance and have been attending for over 10 years.  I have also had instruction at a very reputable school in the pilates industry and I can assure you that what is taught at Balance is DEFINITELY Pilates!  If you are serious and willing to do the work necessary to learning Pilates then this is the place for you!!

This studio doesn't teach Pilates. It teaches some variation that doesn't provide results and injures people. Don't bother!

I have received good service in the paint department and sometimes prices are better than home depot, though website prices will be different than the store.  Peole do seem to iffer help, just not right.

Not always receiving good advice here.

Great place.  Helpful and knowledgable staff

Always know where stuff is, when you ask.  Carry a wide variety of hardware, household, lumber and garden products.

Great selection and the employees are always super helpful!

I love to support local businesses and this one makes it easy. A great selection of everything project and outdoor related, coupled with a knowledgeable, helpful staff make it an easy pick over any big-box Depot store!

Great location with several fuel pumps to keep the wait times down. I usually stop by around 9:40 A.M. and never have to wait. Then I am one of the first customers inside the Store. Great prices!

Good price. Best to go when they first open or just before they close to minimize the wait.

damn costco, bak at it again with the cheap high quality gasoline

Short gas lines.

Planned Parenthood - San Luis Obispo Health Center
I came here to get contraception when I was newly married in 2013. I had to come with my 2yo, who I brought in a stroller, and they told me I couldn't bring the stroller into the back area with the exam rooms. It was mildly inconvenient to walk all the way back to my car, put the stroller back and then walk back to the clinic, but other than that - everything was great. My NP was kind and sympathetic to how quickly I needed my contraception, and I had my rx filled for the whole year.

If I could give the SLO Planned Parenthood Zero stars I would. I scheduled an appointment for today at 9:10 am. After waiting for 40 minutes, I went up to the desk and asked them how much longer the wait would be since I've already waited for 40 minutes. I was told that the wait would be an additional 30-40 minutes. That is absolutely inexcusable.

After asking if this was the norm I was told that it is best to reserve about 2 hours of time, and this is with a scheduled appointment. I took my ID and insurance cards back and left.

Incredibly unorganized and clearly unable to properly manage their time.  I will not be returning to this location nor will I ever recommend.

Forden's
Forden's was extremely professional and the technician did great work. They were very kind to expedite fixing our gas stove issue because the stove is our tenant's only source of heat. Thanks Forden's!

Horrible experience buying a new gas fireplace - sales people (the owner and his son) misrepresented features and prices, so we agreed to the "revised" price. Then when it was delivered we realized that even the revised price did not include the accessories (fan/remote) that we were told were included in the price. So we agreed to pay more, again. The installers did not seem to know what they were doing, even though it was a simple install, one had to return to the shop for parts, then - when our contractor asked the installer if the new flue was to code, his response was "Yeah, I think so" The new fireplace works, but not nearly as well as the smaller insert we bought previously for another home from Pacific Energy in SLO. My suggestion is to stay away.

I called to have my gas fireplace serviced because the pilot light was having problems staying on. They came out the next day and did a great job.  Replaced a few parts and cleaned it all up so it looks and acts brand new. Very happy!

DO NOT SHOP HERE! Worst customer service ever. The dark haired woman with glasses will treat you like dirt if you don't want to drop 2k for a buffet. The woman was so rude I wanted to cash out the gift certificate a friend of mine gave me; however, she refuse to cash it out. They just want to keep the money or force me to support them.

Absolutely amazing selection of crafted unique wood furniture at high but decent prices.

I love this place! They travel all over to find the perfect pieces for their store. I enjoy their variety and selection. High quality , beautiful items. I will definitely be back to my favorite store in San Luis Obispo. 

Love everything about it!  From the unique pieces to the friendly staff.  A first class store all the way around.

I like the unique pieces these guys have. Everything is very original, kinda expensive for some things though.

Cal Poly Health Services
The lady who answers the phone, I'm assuming is their secretary is probably one of the rudest people ever, very in-compassionate to understanding schedules, and the $20 service fee for cancellation is true for this medical care but she also lied about it with other services and other hospitals.

I waited for about an hour, but after expressing my concern, I got noticed and served immediately. Staffs were very professional, kind and helpful, glad to have such a good health center on campus.

Need more staffing suring school year

The medical staff are very professional and helpful; but the main help desk woman is an absolute nightmare. She's very rude and makes students feel like it's their fault that they're sick while simultaneously being the nicest person to her coworkers. It's mind-boggling how she hasn't changed her attitude in the 4 years I've been utilizing health center services. She is efficient at her job but her bedside manner is what I would expect in the penal system and she absolutely should not work in an environment where students are coming to find relief from their ailments.

You either get in and out or get put on a 5 year track waiting.

Shell
Clean polite staff, I like that they're paired with Ralph's rewards (10¬¢ adds up)

Their price for gas is about as expensive as it gets (compared to other stations), but what really gets them the 1 star is charging TWENTY CENTS PER GALLON if you use a credit card. That's HIGHWAY ROBBERY. To Shell - - hey... it's ok... I guess...to charge a premium for the use of a credit card, but 20 cents per gallon is simply stealing.

Like a old fashion gas station from the past. Full service, professional and always nice..

Its an average gas station, good for need to stop for a little donut snack

It's a gas station, but the attendant was very nice and makes jokes every time I'm in there.

The Home Depot
Worst customer service when you need help. As a contractor that spends a freak deal of money very regularly there you'd think they'd be more helpful. Let's just say if there was a Lowe's closer I'd pay of my business card at home depot and go to lowes... oh and a pro desk that no one can figure out a thing and has the best hrs a employee could ask for( just whenever you want to be there) is a joke.

I love Home Depot. The staff are always attentive and go the extra mile to help you find what you are looking for, even when it is very hard to find and it takes a while. I love that they hire people with disabilities, it puts a smile on my face to see them enjoying their job. I love the garden area for multiple reasons:
¬∞ the pot selection is nice
¬∞the hoses are good. (Love the 50ft good year heavy duty flex‚Ñ¢ hose) 
¬∞hose nozzles have good prices 
¬∞nice selection for drought tolerant plants 
¬∞great prices on potting soil (6 bags around $45)

Im at Home Depot a couple times a week and generally get good help when I need it and tonight was better than usual. The gentleman at the paint counter was the quickest, friendliest and least frazzled paint person I've ever had. That alone made my night. Next was Pierre at the self check-out. He asked if I needed help and also pointed me to an open check-out but I told him I should probably go to the cashier because I had to pay with 2 rolls of quarters but  instead he asked me to wait a minute and called his manager real quick, then ran over to the cashier grabbed a $20 in exchange for my quarter rolls and ran it back it over to me.
 Now yes this might be a little thing and something one should do as a customer service representative but more times than not you won't see the extra effort being put in like this. I've been in the customer service position for many years and I really appreciate those who take the extra step and do it willingly. Thanks Pierre

Generally great selection and good prices on a wide range of products, but customer service ranges from excellent to mediocre depending on the employee you happen to catch. I found an item today after a staffer with a handheld computer said they didn't have it. But another helper spent five minutes helping me decide between two colors of one item.

Seem to have pretty much all things. Inexpensive

Amazing Selection and Solid Prices. I'm a hobbyist woodworker and do a lot of DIY home remodel work. Aura has a great selection of all the speciality plywood and hardwoods you could really want. They're helpful and friendly when I've benchmarked their prices to other local options I've been pretty impressed.

Reasonable prices, the staff know their products well and they have a scrap wood pile you can pick through, what more could a hobbyist want?

Shell
This station plays the 2 different prices game which 1st I hate. Then this clown tried to charge $18 for a 6-pack and a bag of ice; he says well 14 for the beer, so......$4 for a bag of ice? Nothing legit about this place. 

I just had the worst experience at a Shell station this one located at 11590 Los Osos Valley Rd San Luis Obispo. I don't recommend trucks to go there. My Ford F-250 normal tired from factory and not heightened just tried to go through the car wash after filling up and paying at the pump for fuel and car wash, found out after purchasing fuel and driving into car wash 6'6" is the height, I thought I have been through other 6'6" car washes so thought nothing of it until scratch over my roof did I hear, so I backed out went to get a refund for the car wash and Rachell the attendant said "Oh well no refunds too bad that I should have known I couldn't fit" I stated I didn't know until I went to go through the car wash, there were no posted signs until you go through the car wash. She said too bad no refund. Well I didn't stop there asked for management she said they are gone , asked for name snipping she was said Patty, I said Patty's last name? She rolled her eyes and said Frost but no use because they won't be back until next week. If anyone has an issue with Shell best to call corporate they were on it right away. I still like Shell gas stations just not this one.

Med Stop Urgent Care
They were fast, caring and took great care of me. I'm visiting from out of state and was in crisis. They were terrific.

Went in with sinus congestion and severe throat pain along with fever, chills...etc. They swabbed me for strep and mono and both came back negative. Somehow decided that meant my throat is fine and sent me home with a ten day prescription for antibiotics for my "sinusitis." Had to go in the next morning when they opened since I hadn't slept at all that night due to severe throat pain that almost had me going to the ER. They made me pay another  co-pay even though I told them I get my situation was overlooked. They gave me a steroid that I only took that one time I was there for the visit and told me to come back next week if I don't get better. I finished the antibiotics seeing little positive feedback only to get even more sick the day after I had ran out of antibiotics. At this point I had paid two co-pays and am more sick than when I had first gone. Seeing two different doctors in two days both not listening to me and my concerns/symptoms and rushed through my actual visits(after waiting 5 hours each time to finally see the doctors) only assessing me for maybe 10-12 minutes each I don't feel I'm going to return there to have them try and fix me considering they've failed me each time and show little interest in the patients health and are more concerned about making as much money as they can by squeezing patients in as fast and lazily as possible. Forewarning:make the trip to arroyo grande where they have better service and doctors who seem to care.

Professional, courteous staff, caring and thorough medical team and virtually no wait. Definitely recommend Med Stop for urgent care.

I needed to have my ears cleaned out before I could have an audiology test.  So rather than wait several weeks for an appointment with my primary care physician, I decided to visit MedStop.  Arrived at 7:50 and the front door opened 5 minutes later.  The front desk staff was very friendly (no rudeness at all), and the two people who treated me in back were professional and helpful.  I left the office at 8:35.  A very satisfying experience.

I had a pretty nasty abscess that had to be surgically opened and stuffed with tape to prevent it returning. A very efficient doctor and clean room. Best medical care I've gotten in SLO at a fraction of the cost and hassle of a Hospital.

This is actually a Valero gas station. We only grab gas and an occasional soda pop here.  No problems experienced doing either.  I guess the biggest problem would be getting back out into traffic, but SLO is just a busy little town.

It is now a Valero Gas Station. Gas prices are some. Of the best in SLO (especially for the area of SLO). Friendly staff too. 

Some what expensive but hard to get to. Gas is really cheep their. Restrooms not public. Won a $20 dallor scratcher there the other day on a dallor scratcher.

No public bathrooms, small selection of beverages and snacks. Price wise, you'll only find cheaper gas at Costco in SLO

Best gas prices in SLO. This is now a Valero station.

Zoey's Home Consignments
I had a great experience in selling our family's teak dining room table and chairs at Zoey's. Maria and Brian were very helpful in determining a fair and well researched asking price for our table and chairs and were clear explaining the process.  They sent us our check once our items quickly sold, just as they said they would!

We were downsizing and wanted some of our furniture to go to a good home, so we took them to Zoey's.  After about two weeks, we discovered the items were for a good price.   I was very happy we made the decision to take our items there.  I should have more items later this summer and will be happy to be in touch with Marie again.

Got a cool desk there which was marked down since it had been there a while. And it was going to be marked down in a couple days so she just gave me that price. Then I was gonna get a lamp that had been there a while and was pretty dusty and had no bulb and she told me I could just have it. Its a decent lamp too just needed a little cleaning. Very friendly people.

Zoey's has a great selection of pre-owned furniture and household items at fair prices. The staff is friendly and willing to help select just the right items for your home.

Easy, breezy. Our items of furniture sold within a month.  Went in, picked up our check...no problems. Smiling üòÅ

SLO Yoga Center
I was traveling through SLO for a couple of days and found SLO Yoga Center online. I took Terry's Yin Yoga class. First time here, and first time doing Yin. Absolutely loved my experience here. Stephanie at the front desk was very warm, welcoming, and helpful. Terry is one of the best yoga teachers I've ever had (I've been doing different types of yoga for about 20 years). His gentle, yet clear approach made it easy to follow and focused my practice in a very deep way. Great modifications and attention to detail. Really good vibes in this studio. Keep up the great work! If I'm ever back through SLO, I will definitely be back!

Super friendly & fun staff.  New location and they are always making improvements to keep their practice fresh and flowing.

I love this place! I am an older, intermediate student, and I have taken classes from nearly every teacher. Each teacher has something unique and wonderful to offer. I thought the fact that many of them are young would mean they might not "know" as much. I am humbled and honored to have this beautiful group of people lead me deeper into my practice of yoga. 

I like the Yin and restorative offerings; Katy is wonderful, as are most of the teachers.  When I had a question on the membership I asked, and it was quickly resolved to my full satisfaction.  Travis is right, it has a very big schedule and diverse range of classes and the space is growing which they needed.  What I like best is the flavor of the place; Jenn and Travis, Rocky, Kiyoko, Hanna, and so many more great spirits . . . it is a pleasure to practice here.  Bring us Sarah Powers . . . please?  Visiting Yogi's are always a treat!

New owners. $20 drop-ins. They pressure you to purchase a membership. Even called me at home. The instructors are all young and with very limited experience. Many of them straight out of yoga teacher training. It is not my cup of tea but it may be yours.

Sanctuary Tobacco Shop
Doug really runs an excellent shop.  He is a very knowledgeable tobaconist, who has been on the business since 1972, and at the Sanctuary since 1992.  He has a great selection of cigars for a small shop,  and his knowledge of pipes is second to none.  The comeraderie that exists at The Sanctuary is remarkable.  A newbie only need show up a few times,  and he's one of the club.

Quaint. Comfortable. Doug is amazing and knowledgeable. In the neighborhood and wanna relax and enjoy a nice cigar or a pipe toke?....This is the place.

This is the place that introduced me to Rocky Patel cigars. And they're awesome.

Doug has the best place ever!!

Best place to smoke I have ever been. Nice community.

The Chop Shop
Best haircut I have ever had! Excellent customer service and attention to detail. Highly recommend!

Fantastic and professional service. They know what they're doing here.

Josh is amazing. He gave me a great beard trim and cleaned up my whole look. I'm looking forward to booking an appointment with him the next time I'm in SLO.

I got my haircut from Supercuts and it was just horrible. Then I discovered The Chop Shop soon and I started getting my haircut from there. Josh is very friendly and usually has open slots, if you are trying to book one a day prior to your visit. 

Chop Shop is the best in the business. Josh is the man. Best cut, best price, best feeling!

French Hospital Medical Center
.When people around here told me not to go to hospitals in this area; I didn't believe them? I had faith in my Dr. Who was excellent. Dr. Fow.......... I had an absolute horrible experience there! The pre op was excellent!  but post was a NIGHT MEAR !!!! I HAD TO CHECK OUT THE VERY NEXT DAY.  THE FACT  THAT PEOPLE ARE THAT CALLOUS AND IGNORANT IN THE HEALING INDUSTRY.????? They put me in a room w/ the TV blaring! .The room mate needed to have her phone taken away.!! and how many people are aloud in a room? She must of had her whole family there.Bunch of rude hillbillies!   The women next to me had something, They were not sure what it was? I heard that. They would get back to her when they knew. Complications of pneumonia.  The tubes going to her lungs, ? I HEARD ABOUT THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND THE INFECTION ON GOING!!!!!!! Only being a few feet away I heard every thing!!  They admitted it was one of the NOISIEST rooms, being next to the entrance doors.I realize the day nurse that was assigned to me had too many patients. Thats just BAD MANAGEMENT!   The management are too cheep to care and too Callous.  THERE WAS ONE SMALL SPACE HIGH UP ON THE WALL FOR FLOWERS? Hard to see them. THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THE ROOMS TOGETHER.  The grave yard nurse did meet my needs.She was FOCUSED, PRESENT ATTENTIVE, .EXCELENT! I MISSED HER. And I could sleep a bit,but the day shift sounds like a full blown party! Loud laughing, Circus like. My  Roommate was on the phone a lot..So  many people in the room, They could have shut my drape, but no. THE FIRST DAY I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING drinking  WATER, AND ICE FOR MY WOUND. I asked for water 3 times. It took 1 1/2 hrs. to get it!   When your hip gets replaced you do need ice on it. My ice pack was room temperature when I woke. After throwing up all day after surgery.WHERE WAS THE NAUSIA MEDS? I was told breakfast is at 7:00 am. It did not come till 8:30 or 9:00 . I waiting to see if I could keep it down? I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET MY BLOOD SUGAR UP BEFORE P.T. AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SHOWED UP. BREAKFAST WAS SO LATE!!!!!! WHAT IS WRONG W/ THE KITCHEN?????? THEY COME IN W/ THESE BIG SMILES, I JUST WANT PEOPLE THAT ARE FOCUSED, and PRESENT!  HAVE SOME INTEGRITY!!!!AROUND ME, WHEN I'M IN A HEALING CRISIS.  Occupational therapist came shortly after that and wanted to get  me up. I told her I was hungry.  She offered some crackers, Which was like paste in my continuously dry mouth. I could not swallow them. WHO IN THERE RIGHT MIND WOULD OFFER ME DRY CRACKER, WHEN THEY WORK IN THAT FIELD YRS. AND ARE WELL AWARE THE MEDS MAKE PATIENTS MOUTH DRY!    She was A real treat!!!    I tried to get up and broke out in a sweet felt like passing out. I needed to eat more than a bowl of cream of wheat. IT HAD BEEN 2 DAYS SINCE I HAD EATEN. The P.T. came , I told her I was hungry and needed protein.She  got me yogurt  brought me a menu,  THE P.T .ALSO DOUBLED MY ICE PACK. WHICH HAD BEEN NEGLECTED THE DAY BEFORE FOLLOWING SURGERY. I WAS IMPRESSED!   I ASKED TO GET A DIFFERENT NURSE, REALIZING I WAS ON THE BACK BURNER , NOT GETTING MY NEEDS MET. THEY DIDN'T RESPECT MY WISHES. I ordered lunch FROM A FRIENDLY GUY, NOT FOCUSED THOUGH! It sounded good, BBQ chicken. It was like eating rubber. WHO CAN'T COOK CHICKEN???? I forced a few bites down knowing I needed protein. I told them I love potatoes any way there cooked. Please! it's my comfort food. He said he would bring me potato salad. No POTATO showed up .Disrespect for the IRISH! just dry broccoli. I had to check out 2 days earlier than my Dr. ordered. I couldn't take any more abuse!!! That hospital is the farthest thing from healing. All there Art on the walls of the main entrance: regarding compassion and healing is a lie. Be honest your CALLOUS!  ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS MONEY. I REALY FEEL SORRY FOR THE INURED VETERANS. IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO SPEEK OUT AFTER DEAD!

If you can, avoid this place. They will over charge for everything. 
Expect surprise bills in a week or two.

My love's recovery from heart surgery was the best experience I've ever had at a hospital. The  team was attentive, gentle, caring and human. Thanks especially to Chris, RN in ICU, for going above and beyond to keep him comfortable, explaining things and making us laugh. You are a true master of care taking and healing. We will be forever grateful!

This hospital has a wonderful staff of kind, compassionate, professional caregivers, but the concept of multi-patient rooms is antiquated and barbaric. We go our entire lives without having to share a sleeping space with strangers, until we are unfortunate enough to be ill or injured to the point where we require overnight care in a hospital. Dignity, privacy, rest and comfort are impossible when the only barrier between you and one, or even two strangers and their friends, family and caregivers, is a curtain. This is no way to spend the most difficult times in our lives. Pointing at other hospitals with a similar layout does not fix the problem. I think you people put "dignity" in the name, so you wouldn't have to spend the money to put dignity in the patient rooms. 

Even the cheapest hotel room is private, secure and quiet, and a hospital stay is anything but inexpensive. I have been hospitalized twice in my life, and was lucky enough to stay in hospitals with single-patient, private rooms both times. 

Please consider adding private rooms to your hospital for the good of your patients and their families.

Update: Dad and Mom both got severe upper respiratory infections following Dad's stay in the hospital, first in a room with one man being treated for a URI, and then in a room with two men being treated for URI's.  Imagine healing from a pacemaker installation with a bad cough.

Had to go to the ER here in the middle of the night when my boyfriend broke his hand. There was only one other patient in the ER and yet it took over two hours to get him settled and x-ray'd. Despite his pain ratings, they refused to give him any pain medication and were convinced it was simply a sprain. Only after nearly three hours did they see his clearly broken bone in the x-ray and say "Oh wow, we should probably get you some pain meds?" That visit took wayyyy too long for an empty ER. There were lots of staff ambling about as if they didn't care, and our nurse took his sweet time with everything.

Pacific Coast Physicians
I see Dr Javitz. He is a very knowledgeable doctor. He manages my health care very well. I have been under his are for about 7 years. Since the group was taken over by Dignity Health about July 2015 I have had billing issues between his office and Blue Cross that I did not have before.

Klaw is/was one of the most awkward experiences i've ever had.  He referred to my desire to have my back pain imaged as "a waste of money".  The doctor that eventually did the surgery, referred to it as "one of the worst cases (he's) ever seen".  We were discussing my exercise habits.  I told him I did martial arts and he pretended like he was going to elbow me in the face and told me about a street fight he had gotten into.  Such a wack.  And...I dealt with debilitating pain for months because he refused to treat it.  

Personally, I'd like to kick Klaw in the shin.

Dr. Kellawon is the worst doctor I have ever been to. Without going into too much detail, I'll just say that she is rude, refused to take my medical concerns seriously, and turned me away from her office because I needed help with my anxiety. She treated me like a drug seeker from the moment I mentioned needing help with panic attacks, and ignored my concerns over my blood pressure. She also did not make eye contact once throughout the appointment, and blames it on needing to look at the computer (which she was not even using for most of the appointment). 

Her PA is very nice, and I've heard good things about the other doctors in her office. However, generally if you try to schedule an appointment with one of them, you get referred to her because she has PLENTY of room for new patients -- I'm guessing because no one ever goes back a second time. I know I certainly won't.

I will miss Dr. Klaw immensely. He was the best.

PacificCoast Physicians is a very professional medical group, Dr. Stilphen MD is my primary care doctor, he is very professional aswell.
Thanks, Rick Schey

Pacific Coast Kitchen & Bath
While under a great deal of stress with not only life events, but also a kitchen and master bath remodel, the breath of fresh air in the whole experience was the staff at Pacific Coast Kitchen & Bath.  Highly recommend a visit to this showroom in San Luis Obispo to pick and choose from all the high end fixtures and accessories.

I visit this designer store often in conjunction with TJ‚Äôs and drool over the exotic stone sinks  and $1500 medicine cabinets.  Do I want a television in my medicine cabinet? NO! A Victoria and Albert bathtub at more than I paid for my car? YES!

Also they have my favorite Costco Biscotti at the door.   I would work there for free just to be surrounded by all the stuff.

I am buying the Toto Promenade drop in bathroom sink for the 1930‚Äôs look.



Really nice employees and great local service.  Very knowledgeable too.   All of their pricing was within +/-2% of internet prices and it was usually cheaper than internet prices.  Highly recommended!!!

Amazing customer service and beautiful bathroom fixtures that can't be found anywhere else in town.  I was so pleased to find a local store that carries Robern and Victoria Albert!  The prices were competitive with what I'd found on the internet.  They didn't lose patience with all of my questions, too. :)  They have supplied the fixtures for two of our bathroom remodels, and we'll be back when we do our kitchen.   I can't say enough good things about this store and the awesome people who work there!

Daylight Home, Lighting & Patio
Bought some new outdoor seating here last month. Their selection is nice and the build quality seems solid. Needed to make the purchase for a large event with limited time to comparison shop, however their prices did seem a bit high. Overall a good experience.

Eclectic mix of indoor and outdoor furniture and accessories.  It's fun to see the new stuff.

They have such a large selection of garden and and accessories I just can't get out of the store with out buying something. I also get ideas for future projects. 

Nice facility for purchasing home decor and indoor/outdoor furniture. The price point is a little high. 

Love the original pieces carried.  Prices are way out of my range.  Very expensive

Good selection and prices on matresses.  Friendly and helpful staff.

I recommend Mattress Outlet. Trista was very helpful, friendly, etc. I took a long time to decide on a bed...so many to choose from...she's patient and zero pressure. The delivery crew was right on time, called ahead per request, and juggled my new bed upstairs with a smile. A good experience...a satisfied customer. Thx!

Inexpensive, friendly service 

Quick and efficient. Didn't wear is down with tech talk.

Beverly's Fabric & Crafts
Beverly's Fabrics has the best choices of fabrics. They have fabrics for upholstery, tablecloths, water proof table tops, fabrics for to make clothes and costumes. The choices are so wonderful. Great patterns and colors. They have a whole craft section and seasonal items. Upstairs there is a sale section. I come here each time I am in town. Bring your own bag, though and no American Express.

Its a good craft store they have everything I ever need. They have a clearance section upstairs where you can find some great stuff and the staff is also very nice!! The only thing I didn't like was that the fabric seems a little over priced compared to other fabric stores.

I wanted to buy the whole store! So many good deals on Christmas decor and other cute stuff. The cashier was really sweet and helpful too!

A really good place to find those items for crafts, and some really great decor. Don't forget to check their upstairs area for some fun shopping and bargains.  They also have a nice variety of yarn.

Good selection of typical fabrics. Fine fabrics limited. Great yarn section!

Susan Polk Insurance Agency, Inc.
My Anthem Blue Cross plan is ending Dec. 31st and Susan Polk assisted me in signing up for Anthem Blue Shield.  Unfortunately she failed to tell me that ABS was going to take my January payment the very next day! This was Nov. 16th.  It was an oversight on her part but I did not have an extra nearly 800$. I called Blue Shield the next day to cancel the policy and they said it would take 7 to 14 business days. I still do not have my money, Dec 12th, and now they are saying it could take upwards of 45 days.  How is it that they can take your money in one day yet not refund it as quickly? the CEO of Anthem Blue Cross makes 110 million dollars a year, I needed this money to live on. I am very weary of insurance companies as well as agents making a profit on the health of Americans. Twice I called Susan Polk to speak with her, the first time she got back to me the next day.  Yesterday I called in the morning and asked for her to please call me.  She hasn't returned my call.  I will not be using the Polk Insurance Agency in the future.

Great insurance folks.  They know all the ins and outs of insurance to find the best plans for you.....

Susan Polk is definitely the one to call for your insurance needs!  Her and her staff are extremely knowledgeable and professional!

Susan really knows her stuff. She is professional, knowledgeable, and trustworthy. So happy to have her be part of my insurance team.

Susan and her team should be the first call for anyone who wants to learn about their health insurance options.  One of the things that amazes me about Susan is that I found out that she read the entire "Affordable Care Act" (ObamaCare).  

I have used Susan's services a number of times.  She helped my mom get health insurance (super important to me), she helped a number of friends find Medicare supplement policies, and I've even bought travel policies to cover travel outside of the US.

Another important note about her business is that she has a variety of long term care policies available and are well versed at explaining the benefits of such policies.  I think that she has lived through so many other people's lives that she know what risks to insure and which risks not to insure.  Susan and her team are always my first call when it comes to health insurance, Medicare, and Long Term Care.

McGee Insurance Agency
Amy from McGee was very helpful in beginning the process of getting insurance setup (home & auto), despite a short timetable ahead of Thanksgiving. Unfortunately, they asked hardly any questions about our home and once the documentation came...there were many mistakes (mainly assumptions made) and I didn't feel comfortable signing the DocuSign (despite them saying later that it didn't matter, come again!?). Since it was the Thanksgiving Holiday, I was unable to reach them via phone or email (4-days), which is understandable.

Ultimately, I did not sign-off...but the insurance went into effect anyhow! In the meantime, I had gone with another insurance company (USAA), who I'm very happy with.

I tried working with both McGee and Mercury on getting a refund for the one-day of insurance I never intended to have, but they refused AND tacked on a 10% fee ($66.76). Since they had collected my bank account information, there was no chance for a chargeback or similar remedy.

Despite McGee saying they have considerable influence over the insurance companies they represent, that was definitely not the case in this unusual circumstance. I commend them helping to act and cancel the unwanted insurance, but am disappointed they could not do more.

McGee Insurance has always done a great job keeping us up to date on our insurance coverage with great rates and customer service.

Morris & Garritano Insurance
Very helpful with employees benefits.

Great place to work.

I switched my auto and renters insurance over to Morris and Garritano a few months ago when Brian Peters, their personal lines agent, was able to increase my coverage for a lower price than my previous insurance- Farmers. A few weeks ago, I was in a in collision and Brian was extremely helpful throughout the entire process. He made sure I was taken care of right away and I was able to get a rental car the next day. He even called the following week to check in and make sure I was doing okay. If you want an agent that cares, Brian is the way to go.

Fantastic group of attentive agents who make you feel important. Not only do I have my personal auto and home with them but I worked with them for large business as well. I cannot recommend this company enough. They treat their clients and employees very well. 

I was so impressed with Brian Peters at Morris & Garritano that I decided to write a review about my experience with him on both Yelp and Google. I switched my Renters and Auto Insurance over from AAA to his office recently and I couldn't believe how much I learned from him. Brian was an insurance guru! He explained each of the policies and coverages to me in detail(in simple terms that I could understand). He even saved me $175 per year! Definitely going to recommend him to my friends and family.

Todd Thomas - State Farm Insurance Agent
I've had Todd as my insurance agent for 4 years while going to college in SLO and Jeff has been my insurance agent since I was 6. He's actually our family insurance guy and we've stayed with him all these years because he is FANTASTIC! Melanie is also absolutely amazing and so helpful on every occasion. I definitely recommend this office to anyone and everyone!

I have worked with Todd and Melanie at the Marsh Street office in San Luis Obispo for about 20 years. They are both so helpful and attentive to my needs, always keeping up to date with the changes in my life. Todd, Melanie, and State Farm have provided great customer service and always give me a sense of security. Other companies always want to compare prices but I'm not even willing to consider moving my business elsewhere. I moved from San Luis Obispo to Sacramento several years back and the service is still top notch. I will stick with this State Farm team no matter where I go. Thank you Todd! Thank you Melanie! Thank you State Farm!

Several years ago my son recommended I move my business to the Todd Thomas agency after I had a bad experience with another agent. Best decision of my life, insurance wise.

The office manager Melanie welcomed me like a long lost relative, and guided me through the process of moving my various insurance policies to the agency, and made the transition seamless and easy.

I met Todd and we discussed the coverage levels on my policies and he was able to lower my rates with several discounts. They continue to be proactive in keeping me posted on my insurance rates and I always confer with them in advance of a vehicle purchase, etc. so they can get me the best rates.

Melanie has been remarkably patient with me when I have questions on policies, and guiding me through the best way to cut through red tape on payments, notices, and the lot.

They are a delight to work with and I appreciate the personal interest they show me and my family. I highly recommend them.

I have been insured with Todd Thomas, State Farm Insurance Agent in San Luis Obispo, CA, for over 10 years. I stumbled across his office when I was first starting out as a college student and just needed auto and renters insurance. Since then they have insured everything from my engagement ring, to our first home, and my husbands business! When we had kids it was important to us to get life insurance, and they took care of that also. Through every change (jobs, cars, homes, kids, etc) I have always been able to depend on Todd Thomas and his professional staff, Melanie, in particular. They all have always treated my husband and I with kindness and respect. They would never waste our time, or try to take advantage of us. We have been very happy with our service at Todd Thomas, and I highly recommend him.

I have had the pleasure of working with Todd Thomas and his State Farm Insurance Agency for well over 10 years now.  They are the absolute best when it comes to insurance.  Todd and his staff go above and beyond to bring their customers the peace of mind that they deserve.  But what really sets them apart from other local State Farm Agencies is their amazing customer service.  These are the kindest group of people you could hope for.  Especially Melanie, she is the best, our family just loves her.  So if you want to be treated like family and receive the best of the best in insurance coverage you should definitely head down to their office at 1238 Marsh Street, San Luis Obispo and see what they can do for you.

Launderosa Laundromats
Don't do your laundry here if you appreciate friendly service. Last month I showed up at 9:03 (last load is allowed in by 9:00) and the employee shouted at me without even looking up from her sweeping "last load at 9:00!" I understand they have a policy to enforce but I don't appreciate being spoken to that way. This time I made sure to get off work early to be there by 8:55 so there would be no problem. The same rude employee was working and she still tried to turn me away! She warned me to be done by 10:00 because that's when they close. I'm very frustrated that this employee is allowed to be so rude. Surely the owners must understand that there is a much nicer way to communicate with your customers.

*Update: After this review, the owner called me back and heartfully apologized, offering a full refund from our last ticket. I appreciate the response and attempts to make the situation right. We will give them another chance.*
We used them 2 times to launder vacation rental laundry. The second time they lost a top sheet and a pillow case. I know what I took in and when I unpacked the laundry about 3 weeks later, as we did not need it until then, the items were missing. I had to leave 3 messages before the owner had the decency to call me back. Once on the phone, she out right denied that it could have happened and flippantly apologized for not returning my messages sooner as she had been out for a month. (?!) Then, she told me that I waited too long to call and tell her that I had items missing. I had to ask her twice why my time frame was too long, but her wait of over a month to return 3 messages was acceptable. At that point, she frustratingly asked me what I wanted. When I answered that I wanted basic customer service and not, in so many terms, calling me a liar, she offered me a discount on the next order. She seemingly ingnored my request of a refund for my missing items. This business is exceptionally disrespectful in their practices of ignoring paid customer concerns and refusing to make sure that we remain customers by honoring my money spent to replace items they lost. Offensive business practices and I will not hesitate to share my experience to anyone that wants to hear my opinion.

Clean laundromat, friendly staff and they will launder your clothes for you (including hanging and ironing as directed) within 24 hours.  Priced by weight. Drop off, pick up next day, extremely convenient.

On vacation and needed a laundromat. Super friendly and extremely helpful staff.  Average prices for wash and drys.  New machines. Would recommend.

Very nice.

I drive a truck and have been to countless laundromats. 

This one is in the top 5.

Lots of machines, even a couple 50 and 75 pounders, with dryers to match.

Very clean, the machines look new, with lots of folding tables, too... What's not to like?

San Luis Obispo Library
After finally getting this welcoming library it's rightfully needed upgrades to it's new open and fresh layout.  When you enter into the bright and open entrance you don't get that depressing grandma's old retro basement vibe the building once had.  The new design gives the place a nice cohesive flow in the way it operates.  The automated drop off slot is fun to use and watch how it sorts everything to it's appropriate box. The media lab/area is finally where it should have been all along, with the second and third floors department relocations making more sense.  Definelty recommend taking your kids to the new revamped 2nd floor if you want a nice break.  Lot's of activities there to occupy the kiddo's.

October 29th, 2008 --  BELLE CHASSE, La. - Just two days before Halloween, "Batman" dropped in for a special visit with 159th Fighter Wing Operations Group and Maintenance Squadron for an exciting adventure.

 Last October, Rivers Lacrouts received a warm welcome as he and his mother, Bridget Simpson, visited the Fighter Wing, part of the Fighter Pilot For a Day program.

 Similar to the "Make a Wish Foundation," coordination for the event began as early as spring 2008, where a base effort was put together to ensure he saw what real pilots do.

 Lt. Col. Sostarics, commander of the 122nd Fighter Squadron, and his family has known Rivers and his mother, for more than four years through his wife's , Nicole, workplace. Sostarics said the event is usually coordinated around operation group missions to allow for a full tour of the jets preparation and execution process. "It's where you get to treat them to a special day," said Sostarics.

 Rivers was diagnosed with Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy at nine-months-old. The disease includes muscle weakness and susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. Even the common cold can lead to pneumonia; therefore he frequents Children's Hospital, said Nicole.

Have been good.

Clean, quiet friendly staff

Newly renovated! Large selection of movies and videos, expanded books and private reading areas.

Pioneer Carpet Cleaners
Very professional and easy to work with. Showed up on time and did a great job. Would use again for sure!

Bobby at Pioneer Carpet did a fantastic job on my carpets in a Cayucos beach house where many people and pets are constantly in and out.  We did have some pet issues and he was able to clean these spots.  He arrived on time and completed his job quickly.  I will definitely use Pioneer again.

Howard was on time, thorough and got the stains out!  While protecting our furniture and walls. I would recommend these guys.

Pioneer Carpet Cleaning does an excellent job!  We have had many people over the years clean our carpet but Pioneer is the best.

We have been using Pioneer Carpet Cleaners for many years. They are always very professional, on time, and do a great job! I just had my carpets cleaned and they look like new.

BevMo!
Easy access from LOVR & Froom Ranch Rd. into a large, shared parking lot.  Have a huge inventory of everything beverage, except eggnog & milk products.  Employees are helpful & will walk you to what you are looking for. Prices are reasonable and if you sign up for member rewards, they mail you a coupon for $10 off purchase of $75 or more, (was $65 beginning of 2017), every so often especially after you make a purchase.  Checkout is quick and they have plenty of empty boxes to put your purchases in.

Top notch products not expensive good sales great service very clean and I love the bathrooms.

BevMo offers a wide selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages ranging from Ramun√© to rare spirits. I especially liked the selection between local and imported beers. Averagely priced with a slight discount for members with free sign-up.

They have about every adult beverage a person could want. I prefer I W Harper bourbon and ther are the only place I could find it.

I like the wide selection but I have to say, prices are a bit higher than Vons or Trader Joe's. I guess to really get the benefit of shopping here, you need to be a member and look out for deals. On the plus side, it's the only place in the area to have lots of French and Italian wines.

Wine Shed
Good spot for drinks after work. Not as busy as places downtown, and there parking. Selection is pretty good for beer (lots of local places), and a lot of local wine

Dog friendly, wheel chair friendly, just plain friendly! We used this place for an annual gathering of friends before the holidays and it worked out perfectly

Great spot to meet with friends and grab a glass of wine. It can get a bit noisy when busy but it has never been a problem.

Great place. Great service. Great selection.

Great little hidden wine bar. Also serves beer if you prefer. Great spot for conversation or to hangout.

Mission Floor care, carpet cleaning san luis obispo
Easy to work with/schedule!  Great service and I'm very happy with the results.

Mission Floor Care did an amazing job cleaning our carpets. The carpets never looked so good. Ritchie was friendly, professional and on time to do the work. I recommend them to everybody. You just can't get better service anywhere.

I used Mission Floor Care when moving out of a house I was renting.  Ritchie did a great job, and charged an excellent price given the amount of carpet that needed to be cleaned. Thanks!

I wish I could do more to get the word out there, MISSION FLOOR CARE IS AMAZING. I have flawless results every single time. I've been a customer for 2 years now and I've never had a problem. I even called Richie once with a bad stain question and his suggestions worked perfectly. He doesn't only do my carpets perfectly, he also has done much of my furniture with fantastic results as well. He's professional, courteous, knowledgable, and extremely reasonably priced and conscientious. I'm always impressed and will never use a different company.

I have been doing business with Mission Floor Care for 14 years & my carpet still looks brand new.  Richie Gill, the owner is very professional and honest.  I trust his work & would recommend him to anyone that is interested in getting their carpets cleaned.  It's hard to find someone that will do good work & that you can trust to come in to your home.  That is why I continue to do business with Mission Floor Care.

Broad Street Laundromat
I left my laundry there overnight by accident period the next day went there to try and retrieve it it was gone. They have cameras there and they were not willing to view them and see who took my clothes. That's the reason I am giving this rating one star other than that the washers are good I suppose and the big giant dryers probably the best driver they have and the folding service who knows how that is all I know is it wouldn't help me it's actually kind of expensive

We take full advantage of their wash and fold service. We drop off the laundry when the hamper gets full and pick up when it's done. The turnaround is usually the same day or, at the latest, next day. Every single person that works there has been friendly and courteous. The only downside to this wonderful laundromat is that now we've become spoiled and I don't even remember how to do laundry anymore.

I came here based off of reviews, clearly they are all false. The facility is not clean, the machines are not in great condition it is way over priced and during my visit there were two sketch ball dudes preparing some drug at the table across from mine. I felt very uncomfortable. I gave one star because nothing wasn't an option. I'm sure this review will get erased but if atleast one person reads this then I saved someone the trouble

Machines are quick to finish and also do a good job. Change machine is present along with some pinball machine too. You'll be done in an hour and a half. 

Run down machines, not very clean, looking for a better option

San Luis Obispo Law Library
The best thing about the San Luis Obispo County Law Library is the staff. All of them are so helpful, and are always willing to point you in the right direction. 

The library is quite small compared to other counties, but I haven't had a problem finding what I need, and they have computers linked to subscription databases that can pull up a lot of information not in the stacks. 

If you need a bigger selection, go to Santa Maria (Santa Barbara County), but if what you're looking for isn't obscure, I'd try San Luis Obispo first and talk to the staff about what you're trying to find.

Cork 'n' Bottle Liquor Store
This is a awesome store. They serve food too. Its a one stop shop.

Great beer selection. Cool guys working the counter.

Love this place, great service, bomb food inside.. I had the pastrami sandwhich, and had the BBQ burger before. Both were delicious. They have a great selection of alcohol. 

The best place for  thirsty men or women looking for something to eat their lips

It's my go-to place in SLO for a cheaper meal. Always a solid sandwich and fries. Although the prices have increased over the years, the food is always good and it gives me a chance to browse the large selection of beers as well as all of the liquor, wine and alcohol game equipment you could need

Robert E. Kennedy Library
Great layout with many different study options (quiet study desks upstairs, group study rooms, etc).

Nice library but I was there during spring break when students were gone, got a nice quiet table with a decent chair on the 5th floor. That's where my photo was taken. Probably gets very busy and despite all the upvotes on the coffeeshop in the library there is a Starbucks nearby in the overpriced market.

This is the best place on campus to have a decent cup of coffee (from Julian's), and get some work done. Ample private work areas, and some group spaces as well.

Best place on campus to get work done. Good coffee, strong Wi-Fi, and quiet individual or group spaces.

Julian's coffee has come in clutch on many an occasion.
There is an atrium in the middle.
There is an art exhibit on the first floor.
You can write on some of the walls‚Ä¶
There are at least six books on just potatoes.
What more could you possibly ask for??

Engle & Associates Insurance Brokers Inc.
I have had two dealings with this business both were with Lisa Murdoch. 
She is extremely rude on the phone.
Getting the required proof of insurance seemed to be such a difficult task when it should have only required one email.
Not impressed with this business.

Johnna Tuson is the easiest and best to work with! I have enjoyed doing business with her and Engle Insurance for over 10 years!

Jayne was very attentive from the start, she listened and she knew what the best way to address my companies needs.

Johnna worked really well with us getting the best and affordable insurance for my daughter with her new car.

Jayne is an incredible agent. She is very professional and will make sure that you are covered properly.

Mr. Conaway got a drunk-driving charge reduced to reckless driving when there seemed like there was no hope. He showed an amazing understanding of the law. He saved me money by reducing my fine and the suspension of my license.

The Gold Concept Jewelry & Design Studio
Brianna, Devon and Aaron are personable, provide fair prices and thoughtfully crafted designs. They work with you if you're on a budget and unlike some retail places within this industry there is a personal, no pressure approach to their customer service.

The Gold Concept is the place to go for something beautiful and unique.  I have been several times and the staff are always helpful; I've even been able to speak directly to the jeweler to design a one-of-a-kind gift. I've purchased both earrings and rings of mixed metals, and I always get compliments on their beauty. They also support the local community--sponsoring bicycling events and showing off their bling at Art After Dark.  I highly recommend shopping there!

My daughter had her ears pierced here. Fantastic job and great price!

Shari Robasciotti - State Farm Insurance Agent
State Farm Insurance has been a staple in my family since before I was born. The ladies at Shari's office really know their stuff. Claudette is a wealth of knowledge, whether it is about home, life or health insurance she can help you navigate the insurance you need. They are diligent in following-up so your policies are always current and you know you're always protected.

Shari and Claudette are such a joy to work with! They do an amazing job of checking in on their clients, making sure everything is up to date, answering any questions I have. Insurance is frustrating, expensive and confusing so it's such a relief knowing there is a qualified and supportive insurance broker to help with all the small and large issues that can arise. I can't recommend State Farm - Shari Robasciotti's office enough!

The ultimate professional staff, always gets the job done right, right now and keeps you smiling and laughing through the process whatever it is. You cant go wrong with these gals.

I have been with State Farm for about 15 years now and every agent I've had (I've moved a few times) has been WONDERFUL and Shari is no exception! I like to have a local agent who knows about the area and can give me personalized attention. I met with Shari for the first time this past week and that's exactly what she did. She explained my different types of insurance to me, made sure I was happy with what I had, or was getting and even dropped by my office the next day to bring me some State Farm items for my expectant baby! Also, I have spoken to Angel several times over the phone and she is just as kind...their customer service is what I'm looking for! Thanks ladies!

Shari and her staff are great!  They are very knowledgable and always go the extra mile to make sure you are a satisfied customer.  I wouldnt trust anyone else with my family's insurance needs.

Kevin Main Jewelry Design & Studio
Only amazing things to say about Kevin Main Jewelry. They went above and beyond finding the perfect pink sapphire, rebuilding the engagement ring setting from scratch, and working with us despite this ring being for my brother (and the woman he will soon propose to) who lives in and is shopping from Mississippi (via me, his SLO-based sister). 

We were not a simple customer, but they were always happy to see us and were so beautifully helpful. Justine, the salesperson, was a dream to work with. And ultimately, we found the perfect rings for my future sister-in-law. All of my jewelry shopping will be done here for the rest of my life. Forever. Amen.

I brought in an inexpensive silver ring - belonging to my daughter- with a lot of sentimental value that had two original design flaws, making it unwearable and likely to break. It was so beautifully repaired and improved that I know it will be in my daughter‚Äôs  possession for the rest of her life. The workmanship was superb. When we sent her a picture of the newly repaired ring via text, she sent us back about 30 different happy emojisüôÇ. Thank you Kevin Main!

Love, love, love going to Kevin Main's. Every time I go in I'm greeted like royalty and every item specially made and designed by Kevin has been perfect. 
I highly recommend this wonderful place!
Thank you to everyone at Kevin Main!

No pressure sales staff. Friendly service. Overall very satisfied with shopping experience.

Kevin created an amazing custom piece for me. I gave him a general idea of what I was looking for and he gave me a masterpiece!

Thanks Kevin Main Jewelers

PS - Libby was cool too!

California Department of Motor Vehicles
All of the 4 or 5 star reviews for this place are likely employees or being paid to make their reviews. Staff here is incompetent, unkind, and impatient. The lady at the "Start Here" station wouldn't even hear my situation. She interrupted several times, and started reaming me for being late on my car's registration. I was there to fix this problem, but she would not show the slightest effort in resolving my problem. Essentially told me if I get pulled over for my late registration "just talk to the cop. see what he says." I understand it's a fairly thankless job, but I've worked in similar places, and it's still possible to show respect to other human beings.

I always go to the dmv in slo and everyone is so friendly until today I met the meanest, rudest, most ugliest woman on planet and when i mean ugly I mean from the inside ! She is the worst woman you can ever deal with ! She was not being polite or helpful at all! Not even a smile or anything! I come up to the window she asks, ‚Äúwhat do you want?‚Äù Seriously ? Can‚Äôt you guys hire less stupid people ? By the way, her name is Jolene Walter! I hope nobody ever gets her when they go there !

Worst experience I have ever had. Horrible staff. I was taking my driving test and turned left at the initial intersection when the arrow turned green and I was then failed for a dangerous maneuver because she said, "I got lucky it turned green". When we got back to the DMV she repeated herself and I said, " I turned when it was green though, right?" And she stated, "Well yes, but you got lucky. I don't think you knew when to turn." I tried to reason with her, but she continued to cut me off and repeat herself. So her thinking I wasn't watching the arrow, but turning when it turned green, resulted in me failing my driving test? I cannot believe it actually happened, it felt as if I were in a comedy sketch. I cannot stress enough how much one should do their best to refrain from ever having to go to the San Luis Obispo DMV.

John, Unless there is an active request for help, the messages will be counted as Spam, Thx, Vet Center FB team

I called 1-800 number today after trying the local number twice and having it go to 'buzzzzz' then dead... and was told at 2:30 that it would be 1 1/2 to 2 hrs before a DMV person could speak to me but they would 'Call me back' as I was 'in phone line'. NO CALL! It's 7:37 pm. Thanks DMV!

Love this place, great selection of non-local wines and very friendly staff. Only wish there was more comfy, lower profile seating.

Love this venue--and the owners and staff are great.  It's a fun place for a party--or go to one of the wine-centric events they put on every week.

James McKiernan Lawyers
Darryl was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Very easy to deal with via phone and mail. 
It was nice knowing I was using the best lawfirm for my needs. 
I would recommend them to friends for sure.

John Hayes has been handling my case and so far it has been so easy. He carefully explains every step of the process and has been understanding with my situation/frustration. They are empathetic with their clients and I know this from experience. I‚Äôm so glad I chose them to represent me!

After being in a multiple car pyle up  with my daughter and myself sustaining injuries and personal property damages a friend referred me to James Mckiernan I went and was greeted with cares and a promise to help and help is a understatement to the impeciable and timely manner that my case worker Daryl and Mr.Mckiernans law office delivered! I'm more than happy for all the help that we received from this firm,a must go to attorney to get you the help you need at a time of great loss due to a motor vehicle accident.

I cannot say thank you enough. My attorney Caleb took such good care of my situation. He was both compassionate and caring. The whole firm was  professional and understanding at all times. My phone calls were answered promptly , even if I left a voice message it was returned within 24 hours. I was so pleasantly surprised and amazed as to how quickly my settlement was handled and settled. I am definitely going to refer  all my family and friends if they every need an attorney this law firm to turn to.
 Again THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH

James McKienan & Associates are the GREATEST!!  They helped us with our
unfortunate incident.  Darryl was our caseworker. He was so kind, understanding, & very helpful.  McKiernan & Associates are certainly the ones you need on your side to take care of everything whenever you or your loved ones may have an unfortunate incident.

She was very forgiving with my limited income. 5 years after my divorce, I see she led our family in a healthy direction. We are now a happy modern divorced family. She also was honest about financial choices I had to make. I never felt rushed. She is strong and capable as an excellent attorney.

The Marchese Law Group was amazing help in a troubled time. They were informative, explained all my options, and helped me navigate a confusing situation. They made something very scary and difficult comfortable and simple. Great follow-up. What a relief! Highly recommended A+++++

Richard worked with my unusual requests and  did an AMAZING job. My wife loved the ring. Thank you for your wonderful customer service and attention to detail.

If you need high quality work done on jewelry, these are you guys! They are totally recasting my engagement ring and making the wedding band and I already know I will love what they did. They are so friendly and dedicated to their work I know I will go to them for years to come!

They were wonderful when I needed a ring done in a week. They were accommodating and very professional. 

Very personable family operation.  Always honest and straightfoward, with an adittional knowledge of Indian jewelry plus more.  Full of interesting stories and fun!  You will like them and will be treated with full disclosure.  I like them alot!!!

Hosford & Hosford, Inc.
I wanted to speak with someone here to discuss my case. There was zero effort to return a phone call, after I finally got someone to talk to me (the person whose name I was given never did speak to me) I was told that there was a $250/hr consultation fee, after which they would tell me if they'd take the case and what their retainer was. I realize people are busy, but a little effort and compassion go a long way - this firm lacks both

Absolutely by far the best law firm in San Luis Obispo County.  Between myself and my husband we have used about 8 different law firms for custody/divorce issues in this county.  None of them come close to the experience I received at this office.  Dealing with custody issues is one of the most gut wrenching scary situations to be in.  I have primary custody of my child and was using John Hosford to try and help with a small disagreement between myself and my childs father.  Out of the blue I was served with papers to try and take primary custody away.  Needless to say this small disagreement turned into a full on battle and I sure as hell picked the right attorney to lead me through this.  I can't say enough wonderful things about all of the staff at this office. Seth, Ami, Jennifer....Everyone knew my name, my case, court dates, items that we were still trying to collect.  I was overwhelmed with the amount of support and calls I received to help me track down information and keep me posted on the case.  As I said dealing with custody issues can be very scary and the worst is when you have an attorney that doesn't take your case as anything more then a job and rarely gives you updates.  One thing I can guarantee is that John and his staff take your case very seriously and have an emotional investment in the outcome.  I have never used an attorney I knew cared about myself my child and making sure he did what was right.  I can count a handful of times through this long process that I received a call from John on his cell phone leaving the courthouse because he couldn't wait to tell me about the outcome.  I can promise you absolutely will not find another attorney that cares this much about you.

My Case recently has come to an end and I can not have asked for a better outcome.  All the points that John and I discussed in the very beginning as being important issues were not only met but ended up exceeding my original request.  My son is still with me and all our financial issues were fixed.  You definitely can not complain when you end up in a better situation then before all this started!!  However, I want to make it very clear that even if I would not have received the amazing outcome i did my review of this firm would still be the same.  I can say with 110% certainty that this office did absolutely everything they could for me and I could not have asked for anything more.

I love Rocks - NPM
This was a new experience for me to go to a rock shop that has SO MANY different things, rocks, crystals, a large variety of jewelry. 
Sharon has her bead section that is really nice. She also has an area where you can work on your things right in the store. 
I was looking for really small Crystal and found the perfect 5, very clear and nice quality. 
I will go back many times, ( unless you have most of the day to hang out) they have so much to see.
I had a hard time finding it in the Marigold Center. IT IS NEXT DOOR TO STARBUCKS

Came in needing some sterling silver wire for a custom order, and Santos took care of me right. Even price-matched Rio Grande.

Highly recommended.

This store is a treasure!  And they are open in Sunday's, despite the listing here on Google. She helped us pick out everything for our projects, looked at what we already had, and even invited us to come in any time to actually sit and create the project!

Silver and Gold Cash For Gold
I went there in desperation with jewelry. I should have walked out but didn‚Äôt it was my own fault. But she totally ripp d me off. I thought she gave me back some of the jewelry but she didn‚Äôt.  She also lied and told me the shop I was headed to was closed. It wasn‚Äôt. They are crooks as far as I am concerned. While I was there a woman came in trying to get her stuff back. I should have known then. Like I said it was my fault I let them take advantage of me. Dont trust them!

Ethan gave a knowledgable apprasial of a couple of Gold coins. He was very helpful and I can tell he knows a lot about what he does. Thanks Ethan!

I love cash4gold & specifically Cynthia - she is awesome, straight forward, and also a delight to chat with. They take gift cards most places won't and have excellent rates for everything from the gift cards to gold. I recommend using their services - in fact I wouldn't go anywhere else. Cash4gold rules

Went in to sell some silver coins.  Cynthia told us she didn't pay premium price for coins only silver value, yet right behimd her is a display of collectible coins!  She then appraised our silver at silver prices minus her fee (10 to 18% as she worked it out).   She gave us the value of $2,197.00.  Wrote out a receipt and gave us the money.  Later that night she called and stated she'd made a mistake and she should have only given us one third as much.  We said we'd be n the next day and bring her the money, which we didn't have to do but we felt it was the right thing to do. When I got there she had yet another new price and wanted $594.00.  I feel like it was a catch and release scam.  I am not at all pleased.  I've written to the BBB about this incident.

Campus Bottle Shoppe
I visited this store to buy a bottle to celebrate my 25th birthday. When I walked in the guy behind the counter was in the phone and made me wait to ask for a bottle of jack that was next to him. I pull out my VALID MN drivers license and he says it's sketchy since it's out of state and asks if I have something else. I happened to have my social security card because I had an interview that day, so I pulled that out and he still denied my. This whole time he's talked on his personal cell phone which is rude honestly. 

This guy runs a liquor store and can't even tell the difference between a real id and a fake idea. I'm guessing he was too lazy to get off the phone to solve an easy issue. Save a headache and go someone else with better prices anyway.

Nice liqour store convienetly located with decent prices

Literally the best camel jockey that I have ever encountered. Thanks Abdul

Petra Mediterranean Pizza and Grill
UPDATED

Petra was another spot recommended by a friend, and it's probably the best Greek food in San Luis Obispo.

The plates are basically deconstructed versions of the sandwich with a side of hummus so they are reliably tasty just like the sandwiches. All of the menu (save for desserts, obviously) is made to order, so every dish is fresh. 
 
Overall, Petra is a little pricey (if not, average for San Luis Obispo), but the quality, authentic taste, and friendly service unquestionably make up for it. The only concern is that the restaurant is somewhat small considering the crowd that dines there, and tables are sometimes hard to come by. Definitely a great place and I am now a loyal customer!

Always great food and great service. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Really nice on tap beer selection too üëç

Modern style counter service mediterranean place. Not a bad bite to eat. Parking is much easier over here. Friendly service too.

But if a limited time in SLO I probably would recommend to prioritize some other restaurants.

Totally fell in love with this place, my boyfriend brought me home a plate and it is simply just DEVINE! I honestly don't know any place like it! It's always fresh, delicious and always a favorite of mine now, my family and friends all love it as well and my mom has been eating here for years! Five stars across the board! Awesome! :) üòç

This place has amazing food. I highly recommend the Greek Feta pizza. They also have a great selection of beer on tap.

Susan Rodriguez - State Farm Insurance Agent
Awful experience with this State Farm Insurance Agent.  Rarely respond to phone calls. For a small correction , I had to call so many times, but still they didn't fix the issue. Very high rates. Every time receive bills , i get different amount. Last month i reported a claim ended up to pay by my self.

Love this State Farm office. Everyone is super helpful and nice. Made me love the whole State Farm company. Keep up the good work, guys!!!! Shout out to Ashley for helping me, you are the bomb!

Attention: Michael L. Tipsord and the following executives Dan E. Arvizu 
Christopher, W. Steven Jones, 
W. H. Knight Jr., Allan

State Farm is a complete scam! When State Farm says full coverage, they really don't mean that. My agent "Susan Rodriguez," out of San Luis Obispo CA, and her employee Almerina Byrum, failed to inform me that my full coverage doesn't include rental coverage. As a customer you expect your agents to keep you up to date with what is covered under your policy and you rely on your agents to educate and advise you as a customer on what is in your best interest on coverages you should maintain. But in my case, I found out the hard way. When my parked SUV was hit by another vehicle, I said to myself: no worries, I have State Farm, they'll jump on this right away and they'll attend and accommodate me with my needed necessities. But unfortunately, that wasn't the case. So when I filed my claim, I come to find out that I don't have car rental coverage in my policy, so therefore, State Farm said they will not be covering my car rental costs. It never crossed my mind that I would be placed in this hardship position. Now, I am stuck with over $600 of car rental costs because State Farm refuses to reimburse me. To make things worse, their claim Adjuster takes his/her sweet time to do an appraisal and delaying the process of starting the repairs on my vehicle, which is just adding to my car rental cost. It's been almost three weeks since my claim was opened and I still haven't gotten my vehicle back. I contacted State Farm and I spoke to Mariah Medina in the Claims Department, and requested they speed up the process because of my car rental cost, but she refused to escalate the matter, and just told me that they're is a process and they certain procedures they have to abide by. So when I requested to speak to a manager, Mariah Medina just placed me on hold until another representative came to the phone. I spoke to this representative by the name of James, and he gave me the same answer, and there was nothing they can do for me. Now I'm stuck with a car rental and have no clue how much I will be paying out of my pocket because I have no clue when the repairs of my vehicle will be completed, nor when my vehicle will be returned to me. I did research with other insurance companies, and come to find out, car rental is included in their full coverage policy. Not only that. They also have non-insured motorists deductible waiver. That is something State Farm doesn't offer. I gave State Farm $200 monthly automatic payments for 10 years, and not once missed one payment, and all State Farm has given back to me is HARDSHIP.  What State Farm doesn't know that my line of business is to locate people for a living from all walks of life. I will escalate the issue to the highest ranks of their company and will retain their executives personal telephone numbers, home addresses and emails, and I will personally contact by phone, letter and emails starting with Michael L. Tipsord, and with continue with the following executives: Dan E. Arvizu, Christopher, W. Steven Jones, 
W. H. Knight Jr., Allan R. Landon, Gary L. Perlin, Susan M. Phillips, Paul T. Stecko, Pamela B. Strobel, John D. Zeglis. 

Can never get a hold of them

Susan helped one of my friends get their claim resolved, which involved switching from one State Farm agent to the other.  She brings a lot of experience to the table, as a former insurance adjuster.  Her office is in downtown SLO and she has a great team.

Marshalls Jewelers
LOVE this place. I have had several "quick fix" jewelers which never seemed right.  This is certainly not some "quick repair, out the door and your gone" kind of place.  Nothing compares with the quality you get from Marshalls. They are awesome!

I would highly recommend this place.  I bought my fiance's ring here and we ended up coming back to buy both of our wedding bands.  They do a great of providing you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.  They are more than happy to answer any questions you might have and I never felt pressured into buying anything from them.  They provide amazing service.  Don't bother going anywhere else.

This is a long term, do it right, have the best, treat all like your best friend kind of place. They have it, can get it or make it any way you want it! We purchased an incredible diamond and emerald ring and my wife couldn't be happier with the ring, the staff, the follow up and everything. We drop in and have them check the stones and the clasps and clean things every so often and they are always happy to serve. Thank you Marshalls

A wonderful jewelry store! We found my wife's wedding ring there and Jeff did a great job helping us find the perfect stone. I highly recommend this place.

I bought my fiance's wedding ring here and ended coming back to purchase our wedding bands.  The two guys on the weekend seem like they have been working there for years and are very friendly and knowlegeable.  They were very understanding of my lack of knowledge in jewelry (I'm a guy c'mon) and gave me open, no pressure answers.  They might be more expensive then the discount place around the corner, but they have the service and quality and to match.

IAN SAUDE, Jewelry & Lifestyle
My wife and I wanted custom wedding rings that best suit who we are.  We instantly fell in love with a band of Ian's own design at his store; the band we chose is a unique design - simple, yet bold.  We have had them now for a month and are constantly getting complimented on them.  We really appreciate how insightful and helpful Ian was in helping us decide on possible customization for each ring; he really has a knack for partnering design to personality while honing in on an elegance that will endure.  We are so happy Ian captured our wish for ourselves in his design.  What's even better? It was extremely affordable and we actually saved money over other considerations we liked much less.      

Ian Saude is best jeweler, hands down, in all of the Central Coast. I have been a loyal customer for several years now. Ian's work is equal to the caliber of the finest jewelry making found in New York and Los Angeles. Ian commissioned my engagement ring and it is beyond fabulous! Unlike other jewelers in the area, Ian's work is contemporary art. Ian is also extraordinarily versed in gemology. Not only is Ian an incredible artist, but he also understands the science behind jewelry making. I look forward to holidays and birthdays in the hopes that I will receive a new piece from Ian's shop. 

Thank you, Ian for adding your artistic brilliance to our community (and to my family). 

Ian presents a new level of relaxed sophistication to the Central Coast community. His shop, managed by the most genuinely helpful and accommodating staff will take the time to show you the various collections from well chosen brands (including his eponymous wares and fine goods). 

Prices range from small seasonal gifts such as handmade scents to some of the most beautiful fine jewelry. Approach with an open mind, the desire to be truly inspired and a generous check book. :) 

Ian Saude is more than a jeweler; he is a creative artist and a trusted business man!  When you walk in the front door of his shop you are immediately put at ease by the warm friendly atmosphere and staff. If you are shopping for fine jewelry, exotic high quality scarves or designer items your experience will be fun and relaxed.  If you are unable to find that special piece of jewelry Ian will design and make it for you; his creative talents are many and I know from experience you will be pleased!!! 


Fantastic options for men and my go-to gift source for the special women in my life.  As a man in SLO finding interesting pieces of jewelry can be a challenge.  I'm not the biggest watch fan, and I've found at Ian Saude a great selection of necklaces, bracelets, and cuff links to dress up my wardrobe.

They are also a great place for luxurious gifts for women.  Their cashmere scarves and women's necklaces are really well received.  

The proprietor is an artists at heart and the staff takes the time to help me find quality pieces for me and the ones I love.

Harris Personal Injury Lawyers, Inc.
HPI has been a huge help to me. All the employee's I encountered were very professional and sympathetic. They made the whole process relaxed and took the stress off of me. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs a personal injury attorney. 

 I recently closed my case with Harris and I was so happy with them! The firm genuinely cares about their clients. They really take the time to explain the process and make sure you get the treatment you need. If you ever are in an accident, Harris is the firm to call for great results!

Best lawyers ever! Very informative and took time to sit down and listen to what I needed. Any questions or concerns I had where answered after my initial consultation. Throughout the entire process I was well taken care of. I highly recommend.

I have heard many positive testimonials about this law firm; now I have one of my own. I highly recommend Harris Personal Injury Lawyers! The staff makes you feel comfortable and welcome. They answered all questions quick and professional, thank you for going above and beyond! You truly have a great team.

I've been nothing but impressed by this firm and the people who work here. They are a good group of people that care about others and work hard for their clients. I have no problem recommending them. Top notch

Finally attorneys you can trust!!!! Jared and his staff are amazing. They are determined to satisfy their clients no matter the cost. They  extended their services in my case until they have received all the documents (that are so time consuming) from the medical insurances yet they still have me my settlement. This was above and beyond customers/client services. I would recommend them to anyone 100%. My case was a vehicle collision that was not my fault. Thank you Harris Personal Injury for all your hard work!!

Paul's Dry Cleaners & Laundry
Impeccable cleaning, fast service, cool local history, and unbeatable prices. Paul's did an amazing job with my bridesmaid's dress and some cashmere sweaters :)

I've been in the restoration industry for almost 9 years now & as part of that industry, when we are cleaning up messes resulting from fires and floods we also include as part of our services the dry cleaning/laundry portion of the cleanup.  I can say from experience having dealt with MANY different cleaners that Paul's Cleaners excels in both quality and value. I have personally tested all the cleaners in the Central Coast area for both business and personal use and I have concluded that Paul's is by far the best. I'll take my clients' and my own garments nowhere else.

Great we'll established dry cleaner.

I went twice, asked for starch both times.  Didn't get it both times.  Also expensive. 

Best cleaners in SLO!! The staff, service and the quality of work is top notch.  I have been coming here for 6 years and have been more than pleased with how wonderful they are.  I had a skirt that had wine stains they got them out.  I also had a suit that was an Armani suit the skirt needed mending and they took care of and sewed the lining.  I love this business!!! I cannot say enough great things about this company!! I love them they have also done my down comforters, drapes and rugs.  They are amazing!!!

San Luis Cleaner Carpets
et me save you all the hard work of trying to find a good carpet cleaning service. This is the best! We just moved to the area and needed to find a good carpet cleaner before we moved in all our furniture. My husband and I did a lot of research and collected bids from multiple companies. Cleaner Carpets was our number one choice for multiple reasons. Not only were they competitive in their pricing and knowledgeable about their service, they were also genuine nice people! The equipment was top notch and they were very professional. We have regularly used carpet cleaners in the past so we have seen both the good and the bad. Cleaner Carpets are definitely among the the best and we are going to use them again.

Greer is the best! Cleaner Carpets has always our number one choice for over 3 years and for multiple reasons. Not only were they competitive in their pricing and knowledgeable about their service, they were also genuine nice people! The equipment is top notch and they were very professional. Cleaner Carpets are definitely among the the best and we are going to continue to use them again and again.

Old World Rugs
It just can't get any better than Old World Rugs.  I recommend them with out any reservation.  I've had them clean two family heirloom rugs in the past year and not only did the rugs come out beautiful, the customer service I received was as good as it could possibly be.  How lucky we are to have them locally.  Outstanding.  If you don't believe me, check them out for your self and you'll see why I'm gushing over the service I received.

Thank you so much for the excellent repair and cleaning of my hook rug! It looks brand new! You're the best!

Very cool rug store in downtown SLO. I brought in a rug I inherited from my grandmother for cleaning because it had been in her attic and was filthy. I was amazed by how well it cleaned up! While I was there, I decided to get a small-ish area rug and Dana was very helpful. We found a very cool unique rug that works perfectly in my bedroom. Would highly recommend!

Amazing !!! What a great group of people, Dana, Harold Wonderful.... I would absolutely highly recommend everybody to shop Old world Rugs...

Top notch for rug cleaning!

Parker Street Coin Laundry
Great place to do laundry. Always friendly people. No restrooms and no laundry service to drop off clothes and pick up later at this location. And a barber shop and beauty salon right nextdoor!  

We've always had dryer issues (machines that don't recognize the door is closed, so it doesn't work and you lose quarters) but after 3x doing laundry here it's a nice quiet spot to do your laundry. Not the best but better than most.

The place is nice enough to look at....
BUT today clothes were stolen...
some homeless man was hanging out there and it seems it was him...

Advertises WiFi on signs everywhere but no security key posted. No attendant to ask. Phone number is disconnected. Came to do homework but realized no WiFi after loading machine.

Laurel Lane Market & Liquor
Expensive...But,....when you're too lazy to leave the neighborhood,... a couple dollars doesn't mean that much and there's a great selection of Beers, not to mention the Ice cream on a hot day...

Friendly and helpful staff. :)

These guys may have decent beer for sale, but they are trying to sell Bourbon County Stout (the regular version) for $40, far from the suggested sale price of $11-12.

A little pricey.

Great friendly service, wide selection of craft brews, a surprising amount of basic necessities. 

========================================================
Baxter Moerman
Nice high end custom jewelry. They do very artistic work.  Prices are fair & the stones are of excellent quality.  Friendly service.  They immediately recognized that I was sporting a fine star ruby on my hand...so they do know their stuff.  The star sapphire that they had on display was of high quality.  They had mostly women's setting's but could do either.

The guys behind Baxter Moerman are not only extremely talented but super cool humans. They were so interested in our story and lives that we knew immediately they were the ones to craft a ring out of some family stones. I went to a lot of other jewelers in town and it wasn't that way AT ALL. They set themselves apart in the most genuine, authentic way. And to top it all off, the rings were absolutely amazing.

I put my trust into their hands when it was time to propose. These guys nailed it! I can't say how happy she was...thanks again guys!

Matt and Matt are so nice to work with and willing to spend a lot of time to make sure you are happy with their designs.  I had some earrings made into rings and I love the way they turned out.  The are contemporary, but classic.  Very pleased with the craftsmanship and the entire process from start to finish.  A great place in SLO to do business!

Matt and Matt do great work at affordable prices. Custom or pre made works. Matt custom made my wife's engagement ring from a picture of a 1920's vintage ring that I could not afford and it turned out perfect and with in my budget. My family has continued to purchase hand crafted jewelry from them and would never buy anything else where. I recommend them to all my friends and they are never disappointed with Matt's work!

========================================================
Yervant Jewelers
Really fast service and a nice price.

Replaced my Marathon Navigator watch battery for $10 and he polished my glass for free. Watch looks as good as new (at least the face). No wait, no appointment, and it took less than 5 minutes. My watch has a Swiss Made movement, and I wanted to get the replacement done by a craftsman. I highly recommend Mr. Yervant for watch repair needs. He is an authorized Seiko dealer, as well.  

My watch broke while I was visiting town for a few days. Tried a couple of jewelers I found walking around downtown and none could fix it. Finally looked on Google and found Yervant and he said it'd be no problem. When I got there, he was very friendly and fixed it in about 5 minutes.

VERY FLEXIBLE! He has switched out about 5 bands for me with no issues. Only place in SLO I will take my watches to.

Fantastic service.  Fixed 3 watches very quickly.  Recommend! !

Somogyi Edward
This man is abusive, arrogant, and dishonest.   Don't walk, RUN in the opposite direction!!   He is a bully, and does not care about the best interest of his client, nor does he have any character or one shred of integrity.    AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  If going up against him, be aware your attorney will get the run around left and right, up and down, all day long, costing you a lot more in fees.   It's all a game.   =(

If I could give less than 1 star I would. Edward Somogyi has been holding my deceased husband's trust since 1997. I called several times after my husband's death to claim the trust to care for my 3 small children, the youngest being 4 years old. Each time I called, they told me there was no money, or trust. I continued to call because I knew the money was there and had documentation. Last May 2, 2015, Edward Somogyi finally reported the trust to the California State Controller's office without regard to the laws which provide that he turn the trust over to the beneficiary [spouse - me]. After several contacts with his office and him this morning, he is still saying they do not have the money and he has no legal obligation to me despite reporting it to the state. This guy is a crook. His bookkeeper, Holly has yet to to return my calls for disbursement. It's been almost 20 years. Trust was being kept from us by Edward Somogyi. I have reported him to the CA State Bar and the State is intervening on my behalf. If you want an attorney that is honest and forthright, Edward Somogyi is not the right attorney you're looking for. Be careful. Going through divorce is hard enough without trying to hire a dick so your partner won't get "everything." In the end he will treat you the way he deals with your partner. That being said, my husband and I reconciled before he passed away and the retainer kept unlawfully because Edward Somogyi is just that way. Engage at your own risk.

over charges by dragging the case, total flake, cares about your money not your case, do not trust this firm.

This guy talks forever and gets nothing done.

Toews Law Group, Inc.
I was referred to Chris Toews when my mom's rather detailed trust needed updating.  During that time I also got to know and work with Shannon Bio.  In all my face to face, phone, and email dealings with Shannon, I found her to be knowledgeable, easy to talk to, extremely helpful, and thorough.  If you email her, expect a very speedy response.  I highly recommend her for estate issues.

I worked closely with Shannon Bio in settling my parent's trust and a resultant special needs trust.  I found her an efficient, detailed, knowledgeable and kind attorney.  I am sure she is an invaluable asset to the partners of the firm.  It was a pleasure to work with her.

Working with Shannon Bio at Toews & Murphy was a breeze. She helped us put together our family trust and made a lot of suggestions we had not thought of. What a great relief to have our trust complete and we have Shannon to thank for it. 

I went to Shannon Bio at Toews & Murphy. She was personable, straightforward, easy to talk to and took care of things very efficiently. I also had contact with their office manager/administrative assistant Jessica. She was pretty delightful. I'm very happy with the help and service I received from this firm.

Shannon Bio's professionalism and vast experience helped make a very difficult situation tenable and seamless. I would recommend her, and Toew's and Murphy, to anyone.

Great service, nice guys, and excellent results. Highly recommended.

Cuesta Cleaning did an incredible job on my carpets!  I've had my carpets cleaned by a few other companies in the past but Cuesta was the only one who made them look brand new.  And the stains have not come back.  They're very knowledgeable in treating different types of stains and really take their time to do the job right.  I highly recommend them and will continue to use them in the future!

Google automatically generated the wrong social security phone #. After an hour wait I found out this 800number is not the one for SLO. Are you drinking kidding me...

I've had the misfortune of needing to call this office twice. Everyone i've encountered has been angry and confrontational.

First call: the worker became angry after I asked her to repeat a question. She hung up on me when I didn't answer the next question immediately.

Second call: the worker became very confrontational with me saying she couldn't help me and I needed to "take it up with the state". A worker on the 800 number resolved the issue for me in a matter of minutes.

Actually treated me like a human being , for the most part.  Did not help me fill out forms (ADA  violation) otherwise most of my experiences have been positive (FYI:  I had to PAY somebody to do this post because I can't read or write, thanks to my parents keeping me IN THE DARK as far as learning MOST OF MY LIFE and every government agency (local and federal) unwilling (they claim "unable") to help me just get their stupid forms filled out.  Its hard to find HONEST people out there.

Graduate Restaurants Inc
Came here for lunch with a BOGO entre offer. Grad burger is tasty charbroiled flavor. Love the fact that you can pick your own toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, onion, etc.) from a cart on the side of the pick up window. This allowed me to put exactly how much of what I wanted on the burger. Price is about average for a 1/2 pound burger. Overall good experience. Beer choice is good and offers a full bar since doubles as a nightclub in the evening. Might just be back to try that out.

Totally cool place to go for lunch or dinner or just hang out & grab a 'cold one'!! (Have your "D/D") with you if ur planning on having more than 2 'drinks'! They have "great food" & good prices!

I've been to the grad for various occasions... Security and operational staff are always respectful and on their game.  Bartenders a bit salty but never rude...damn they can pour a fierce drink though!

This place was ok. We walked in around 3pm and it had a wired feeling because it was dead and a really open place. It ended being clean and staff and friendly. A really awesome plus was that that they had a condiment bar for your food. So you can add lettuce, tomato, onion, and what ever else you like to your food. Beer was really reasonable priced. Food was ok priced. I don't know if I would pay that much again for what we got. 
I got a chicken avocado club. A thick piece of grilled chicken was grilled nicely with flavor. Got like a half of avocado with nice really crispy bacon. Lots of fries that were ok and unsalted which was nice in my opinion. 
Overall I would like to see this place during the popping times.

Walked into country night (Thursday nights). Little bit different than I imagined, lots of people dressed in cowboy hats and boots that line dance to not only country music, but rap and pop too. If you not a line dancer and you are looking to dance, stay clear of "country nights". Definitely not your Midwest country music night!

Apple Farm
Great food and OK service, depending on the server. It's just weird that you have to go through the gift shop to get to the restaurant... Eggs Benedict, country fried steak, biscuits and the cinnamon French toast are all good and I would get them all again. They lack in some of the little things like filling up the water and offering condiments, but that depends on the server. Keith is great, but not everyone is like Keith. The goal of the business should be to put rules in place to make it easy for all servers to be like Keith.

This is a very nice hotel. We go there around Christmas and their decorations are amazing! The welcome cookies are some of the best and you also get a free glass of wine. The room is spacious and comfortable and clean. We actually stay another night on the return trip.

Apple Farm has a delicious breakfast menu. Everytime I visit I love getting the blueberry pancakes- they are delicious and huge! If you have a larger group I recommend making reservation, on a busy day without a reservation the wait will be over half an hour, if not over an hour. Overall, excellence service, food, and views!

Apple Farm's restaurant never disappoints! Our meals are always hot, delicious, and made from quality ingredients. Staff are friendly and attentive. There's much to see indoors and on their grounds after you've finished eating. Grab your favorite pastry as you leave. You won't regret it!

I love this place! The Apple Farm will charm you with its decor, unique but traditional flavor, and friendly hospitality. It's beautifully decorated at Christmas time, the food is divine, and the gift shop is a must! Loved having the chance to visit again. Great memories remain.

Wingstop
Absolutely incredible. I don't exaggerate when I say that these are the greatest wings I've ever tasted in my entire life. The chicken is succulent and comes off the bone just right and the seasoning is just to die for. Come here and get ready for an experience.

I wish that they'd specify the wings were dry rub instead of sauce which i was thinking they would be. went in on tuesday at about 9:30, and they had told me the wait time would be about 17 minutes when i was the only one there (sounded unbelievable to me). though they were just over estimating just so that no one would complain about the time if it took longer. i also found out that the sauces such as ranch and blue cheese cost $1 each. really, a $1 for sauce where most other places give them out free?

I've eaten here a couple times.  My problem is not with the food, the food is fine, my problem is with the staff shutting the place down early.  You've literally got a BIG neon sign in the window that's boasting "OPEN TIL' MIDNIGHT"  and last Saturday night, I was there at 11:35 and refused service. 

So this Saturday night at 11:20pm  I just got out of a recording session, hungry as all get-out, I tried calling my order ahead twice.  Both times it went to voicemail.  So I drove over, parked out front and when I came to the counter at 11:35PM the guy looked at me and said they just took the last order for the night.  Really?  C'mon.  I called twice.

I've encountered this a few times now enough to write this.   Now I have all due sympathy to work staff not wanting to get slammed right before closing and I'm always very gracious in those situations.  If a tip option is given, I go 20 to 25%.  I've worked in restaurants, I get it,  but if you don't want to be open until midnight, don't advertise it.   This wingstop is located on one of the busiest corners of a college town that is known to be out late.  It wasn't as though it was a slow night.      

I often play gigs that go from 9pm to 12am and at 11:20, I don't get up on the mic and say "Sorry guys, I'm going to stop it here because I'm scheduled to 12am and I want to start packing up my equipment so I can get home on time."   Do you know how quickly I'd be fired?  I play my set as posted and then when the place closes I break down my gear.  That's the job I'm hired to do and the job the staff at wing stop is hired to do.

If you want to be open until 11:30, I'm fine with that, but don't refuse customers a good 25minutes before closing.  Seriously, get your fast food chain restaurant out of this town if you're not going to play by the same rules the locals do.  We don't need you here.

If I could I would give this place no stars, the service is snail paced slow...

The wings always taste hella burnt

Broad Street Ribline
My food came quickly but my partner's was awkwardly slow. They said it was because of a new menue in the computer system, hooefully they work it out. Food was good.

Amazing, I had their Tri-Tip salad most places you in my get a little meat. This was THE BEST Tri Tip salad I ever hadüëçüëç. I can't believe I've never eaten here before. We need one in Paso

Took 45mins for a order I called to go. When I arrived to pick up order they forgot to make my beach balls. So after waiting I got my order when I went to eat my sandwich it was already cold. Guess it was my fault for ordering to go. Employees didn't seem to care at all.

Best food in SLO. We frequent here readily as the portions are large and consistently delicious. Beef ribs are amazing. Pretty much everything we have ordered is perfect, savory and cooked to perfection!.. Generous slice of carrot cake for desert!....so save room!

Great flavors, meats and sides. Out shines most local bbq places. Going to try the one in Grover Beach for comparison

Lamplighter Inn & Suites Downtown San Luis Obispo
Great location, clean rooms, helpful staff. Minor maintenance issues like power outlets being rather loose.

For a 2-star hotel, it does the job quite well. Friendly staff. Clean rooms. Good American breakfast. A good place to stay if visiting Morro Bay in the north or Oceano Dunes in the south.

Love this hotel. Great price. Clean rooms. Great customer service.

Not a bad place. Giving it a 3 star. Breakfast was ok.

Our room seemed like it hadn't been cleaned properly. Property was quite and safe so no real complaints other then maybe a cleaner room that's all.

Best Western Plus Royal Oak Hotel
This is a solid three star hotel, well-maintained. Friendly staff.  It has a surprisingly nice courtyard pool area. I paid approximately $10 more for a room on the courtyard. My room was very quiet, although that might have been due in part to this being low season. The included breakfast was pretty standard, but it included cut up fresh fruit, which was most appreciated. Also, they have a fenced dog bathroom area in the back, which was also appreciated. I would definitely return.

A very nice motel, and a haven with clean air during the Thomas Fire (12/17). The front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful, providing a map to help us get around town. Breakfast was good, but got a bit "old" after 18 days. As in many motels the maids primary language is Spanish, but we were always able to make our needs known. Plus, you get a 20% discount at the IHOP next door by showing your room key!

lovely hotel.  comfortable beds, quiet, pet-friendly, very clean, we really were happy there.  
very good for its type of hotel ie not a five-star hotel with the big prices and all the services but perfect for our needs.

We stayed at this hotel for 1 night when we travelled up the West Coast to San Francisco. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Check in was really quick. At first looks it's a bit dated. Our room had 2 double beds in. It was very spacious with a spotlessly clean bathroom. The beds were very comfortable with nice quality fresh bedding. Breakfast was a buffet style. Everything you could want to get you started for the day. The coffee was awful though!! Although it's right on the road we didn't hear any night traffic and we were overlooking it. Great hotel for a quick 1 or 2 night stop.

Great place to stay, every thing was clean, comfortable and great price. I would stay here again. People were friendly and tried to accommodate my needs as much as possible. I would recommend it

okay literally the worst i called today at 10 am and was on hold for so long and some automated voice finally came on the line and said to press 1, hang up, and they'd call me back. 12 hours later and still no call back. so thanks a lot for that.

Great great idea!

Convenient and quick

So easy!

Holiday Inn Express San Luis Obispo
For being under renovation it was a very pleasant experience. They were very accommodating of our needs. The rooms were a bit crowded but comfortable for the most part.

This is a very clean and nice hotel!  The staff is super friendly.  There is a nice breakfast with the room and the coffee is pretty good too. They have a wonderful meeting room in case you have a small group and there is a lovely outdoor patio space as well where you can sit and read just enjoy some sun.

Not as fresh or clean as expected, compaired with other Holiday Express hotels we've stayed. They need to do more than paint the old brown doors white, and wall paper over the textured walls with the remodel that's underway.

Good location. Staff was very accomidating. Fast check in and check out.

Very friendly staff. Going through a remodel as of 11/2017, but a very nice place to stay. I definitely want to come back

Hampton Inn & Suites San Luis Obispo
Very nice hotel. Unfortunately they did not have space for us on a last minute trip. But their staff help me find another hotel near by. Thank you. Very much appreciated the assistance.

The location was great and close to many shops. Costco is just one stoplight away. Our room/suite was large and very spacious. Free breakfast from 6 to 10am is a great addition. You are minutes from Cal Poly SLO and Old Town. The customer service is impeccable. You'll enjoy your stay there.

Everyone was great... Got in around midnight so I was extremely tired. Slept only a couple hours and got back on the road... Missed breakfast but was told it's good.

Super friendly front desk staff - very helpful. Rooms were clean and modern, exactly what I'd expect from a Hilton company. Breakfast was also great, with a variety of food choices.

This Hampton inn ROCKS! The nice lady who was at the front desk when we checked in at 1040pm on July 6th was absolutely wonderful!! She called a popular restaurant for us to let them know we were on our way and we were so happy!! Our room was in wonderful condition! Everything was clean and we'll decorated! The even made a design in the tissues, we'd been staying at Hilton almost exclusively until this night and this Hampton inn was definitely up to par!

San Luis Creek Lodge
There's quite a bit to write, so I'll put it in point form:

Pros:
* Quaint, quiet, and clean
* Rooms and washrooms are a nice size
* Perfect for couples
* Close to downtown SLO
* Lots of restaurants nearby
* Complimentary breakfast is great
* Bicycles and DVDs available to borrow
* They keep a list of upcoming events
* Trolley stops outside
* Friendly service
* No smoking
* Pets are allowed

Cons:
* Free WiFi is not password protected
* Free WiFi could not connect at all
* Bedsheets had old stains on them
* Bed is uncomfortable
* Pillows are too soft

The room is awesome they're all a little bit different and the fireplace is cool. I will stay here again.

Quiet rooms. Lots if amenities. Full Direct TV with a DVD player.  Continental breakfast was very good. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Even had loaner bikes you could use to ride through downtown. Only drawback was the parking, very tight with no outlet on a steep grade

Comfortable quiet rooms, with a bed and breakfast feel.  Nice furnishings and decorations make the rooms a comfortable place to spend some time.

Very nicely appointed rooms,  away from traffic noise. Were able to check in early without any problem. Very polite staff member on check in desk updated us happily with information about the town, restuarants etc.

Super 8 San Luis Obispo
Basic clean budget hotel.  It seems that the owners tried to cut corners where they could, even doing there own maintenance.  There are ugly patch jobs on the bathroom walls where the shower curtain used to be mounted and the town rack is far from level.  There were two of us standing there when we checked in, but we were only given one room key.  The only toiletries provided in the room were bar soap and shampoo.  The breakfast has a waffle maker, but just toast and muffins to accompany it.  Great if you are on a high-carb diet.  The hot tub has been replaced with a concrete slab.  There is a walk in closet, but the only thing in the closet is a mini-fridge with a microwave on top.  The bar to hang clothes is not in the closet, but on the wall right in front of the closet door, partially blocking the doorway.  There are motion sensor light switches in the room, making it impossible to move around without lights coming on when you don't want them to.  The front curtains do not keep light from coming in on all sides when closed, making it impossible to keep the outside lights out when trying to sleep at night.  The bottom sheet on the bed is a flat sheet that is not big enough to wrap around the bottom of the mattress.  You can open the front window and bathroom window to get a cross breeze, which is nice.

Stayed here for a night. Got a king bed instead of the requested queen but that's about it. Everything else was okay-just okay.

Good, central location. The rooms are a little on the small side, but clean and not bad for the value. Parking can be an issue if the hotel is full but it was not a problem when I was there. It's far from a transcendent hotel experience but if you need a bed, bathroom, and door with a lock, this is your place.

A good price, clean, nice attention. It comes with free wifi and breakfast which seem to be provided after an extra charge in other hotels.

Bed was good. Shower was awful. I would stay again.

La Cuesta Inn
Great place for parents of Cal Poly students, it is blocks from campus, but in a really quiet, nice location. Rooms were very nice, some with balconies, frig, microwave, very modern decor. Free cookies and coffee offered in the afternoon and free breakfast in the am. They offer parking under the building, which is convenient for loading and unloading, but low clearance, so cars with car top carriers may run into problems in some of the spaces. They offer a good discount for parents of Cal Poly students. Right off of the main highway, so easy to get out and around from this location.

Stopped here overnight on our journey to Monterey. Very friendly welcome on arrival. Room was fine, although we thought that the outdoor pool was a little too cold to swim in. The complimentary breakfast was basic, consisting mainly of bread, cereal, juice etc. The coffee and biscuits available in the afternoon was a nice touch.

Beautiful, very clean place. Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.. Will definitively return.

Always great service and prices

This is an older building but the updates they do have are very nice. The staff was all very friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, and the location was very close to Cal Poly. I also enjoyed the free breakfast. Oh and the mattresses were some of the most comfortable I have experienced at a hotel.

Embassy Suites by Hilton San Luis Obispo
Guests rooms are large and I liked the sitting area.  Room service was decent.  They offer a cocktail hour in the lobby.  Breakfast buffet is extensive.  A short walk to a shopping center and a quick drive to the airport.  Lots of parking available.

I've been staying here during the week for 7 weeks now. The Hotel is doing a lot of remodeling and will be really nice when finished. The free breakfast is amazing. So many choices including made to order omelets and eggs. They have complimentary open bar with appetizers every night from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. The rooms are nice but carpets need deep cleaning and the maid service is not very good on a consistent basis by forgetting to leave clean towels, not making the bed, and a couple of times skipped my room all together. Overall great hotel but need to clean the carpets and require a higher standard with the cleaning staff.

Stayed for one week at the Embassy Suites, enjoyed the large guest rooms that were clean and comfortable, however could use some modern updating. Hotel was under renovations during our stay but it was not overly noticeable. Free Happy Hour in the evenings with snacks, cocktails, wine etc. and free extensive breakfast buffet every morning including hot and cold options and made to order omelette station. Breakfast was very busy every morning and a bit chaotic, staff tried to keep the buffet full as possible but at times food and beverages ran out for periods of time. Overall this is a reasonably priced place to stay in a good location in SLO with access to amenities, close to shopping and the airport.

Rooms are fine, though the sofabed in our room is showing some wear. Lobby is nice. Breakfast was below average. We stay at a lot of Embassy Suites because they work well for our family of five. This hotel is smaller than most with only four floors. But it is next to a big shopping area which is a plus. It was fine for one night while we were visiting family but I wouldn't vacation here as a destination.

Nice hotel. I stayed in a ground floor suite for a week. Breakfast is free and expansive but the pancakes sucked. They serve free drinks for two hours a night which was awesome.

The Habit Burger Grill
Love coming here with my wife nearly everytime when we get lunch. One of the best burger places to eat, next to in n out. This place, to me, may be a new rival to in n out.

This is my new favorite place ever. The food is amazing. Suck on that mcdonalds

Great food, great service. Laura is awesome. I took my four year old to the bathroom and she had brought our food out, right before we sat on. She's really on it. Sharp, friendly, efficient.

They have a friendly environment, good food, good and fast services, very clean.

A decent chain restaurant. Clean interior with good burgers. Nothing super exciting.

========================================================
Gino's Pizza SLO
This is a wonderful Italian Restaurant and Pizza Place. We had pizza and salads here. The salad we had was an antipasto salad and it was the most absolutely amazing Pizza salad I think I've ever had. The pizza was exceptional and reasonably priced. They have remodeled the place since it became Gino's and it is lovely inside. It's a casual family friendly type place and has a little game room.

I ordered the calzone and it was very good.  Margherita style add pepperoni.. next time I would say easy on the tomato though...

We had a delicious medium pizza with lots of veggies. Fun place with great service and a gameroom. We played air hockey! Will have to try the calzone next time.

A nice family-friendly atmosphere while also being a great place to have a few beers! Decent enough pizza, with gluten free options, and plenty of arcade games for the kids!

Salad they gave me alot of veggiea also (green pep,onion,mush,tom)

Garden Street Inn
Breakfast (best eggs Benedict I've ever had) is excellent but ends a bit too early for a late riser like me. Room was adorable and had a Jacuzzi tub! Would have been nice to have a coffee maker or electric kettle in the dining room for hot drinks past 8pm. The tea selection was amazing. They have a piano there for guests to play, and a sitting room with fireplace. Charming b and b that is reminiscent of some of the places we've stayed in the UK. Free fresh cookies were delivered to our room every day. Beds were very comfy and staff was friendly and accommodating. Right near the downtown shopping center of SLO!

Great location, nice room/bathroom and friendly staff.

Best place to stay in downtown SLO. Cute rooms, great location and a great breakfast. Staff very friendly. Highly recommended

Turn back time in this nicely restored home. Staff is friendly and the chef talented. Great place to stay

Great visit... will see you next time for sure!

Madonna Inn
Love this place! I've stayed here 3 times, and it never gets old! This last visit I went with my Mom and brother. We stayed in the San Francisco room - we all loved the red/gold fun theme! Breakfast and dinner in the one-of-a-kind restaurant was delicious and entertaining. We felt like we stepped back in time. Loved seeing the characters who are attracted this place. Our trip included a visit to Hearst Castle nearby, which added to the unique memory.

I did not stay at the Madonna Inn but I did use the spa facilities.  The offerings were very nice.  The massage specialist was friendly and listened to my needs.  They offer hot tea and warm fluffy robes while you wait.  The changing area is clean and spacious.  I ended my afternoon at the caf√© on site.  I had to order a few items just for the serving dishes.  Very cute lunch spot.

I thought racism was dead until I walked into the Madonna in. Called ahead to make reservations. Had plans to have dessert & drinks there since everyone says the cake is great. We sat down and moments later were asked to move. Apparently you can only sit in the restaurant if you are having an entree. Which no one ever told us when we made the reservation. The servers words were "you need to have at least one entree." So then we thought about getting one just so that we could continue our night and then she changed it to "you must have a few." She said we would have to sit in the dancing/bar area. So we had to move from our table over to the bar area. The place was practically empty and no one was waiting but we still were forced to move. The server said she would have someone take our order but it wasn't until about 30 min later that someone come over and that's only because we got up and asked. When the server did come she was very rude. She dropped the menus and left. She was coughing and sneezing. I wanted to feel
Bad for her for working when she's sick but even when we tried to be nice to her she was still rude. Everyone else had Ice cold drinks and ours looked and tasted like it came right out of the faucet. They were out of every cake we wanted and the one slice we did get was not good at all! We were only given one fork for 7 people so we had to ask for forks and plates. The atmosphere of the people there was nice and friendly for the most part but the employees were not! Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, we started to walk to the front to pay and one of the servers started to run towards us and comment that we were trying to skip out the bill. We got to the counter and 6 workers were there talking about personal things and no one would stop to help us. When they finally decided to talk to us, they said they could not help us there and sent us to the bar to pay. No one and I mean no one was friendly to us. We were the only Mexican people there and sadly it was very evident that we were being treated different then everyone else. To accuse us of skipping out on the bill was just so petty and sad. I would never go back there because it is not a place that seems to be open to people of color. I wish this was something I could report to the authorities. Don't put yourself through what we went through :(

The Good: 
This place has a very interesting atmosphere. Very cool themed walls and decorations. Staff was professional and did a good job up-selling.

The Bad:
Late on getting our group to our table as per our reservation. Food was very expensive and didn‚Äôt match the quality taste you would expect from paying s premium. My steak was lukewarm meaning it had been sitting a little bit and the taste was not what I expected for paying $40 for it. 

Unfortunately when you charge a premium price, the food has to have the value assigned to it. There are many other restaurants that are cheaper in the area that would be a better choice than Madonnas. If the food was less expensive, I would of given it a 4/5.

Don't bother. If you're a person of color they treat you like a second class citizen. Trying to get dinner reservations was a joke. Won't be spending any of my cash at this establishment. They need to check the girls who take the reservations. Their attitudes need a customer service adjustments. I would've waited 2 hours if they were more warm and inviting. But they missed the mark with that mouth and body language. Bye bye.

Which Wich Superior Sandwiches
Love the food here!! Wish there was a location up near the marigold center..   Update 2017  I'm pretty pissed because I think the staff closes early when the boss isn't there.    They usually stay open till 9 but recently have been closing early.   I love their food but this is bad business

Make your own sandwich place. Pretty good sandwiches. Lots of option including hot/flat/cold/size/ingredients. Sometimes I'm not sure why the wait's long.

Love at first visit! The vegan sandwich displayed on the A board out front drew me in, the friendly staff and warm atmosphere cinched it! This will be my go-to place in San Luis Obispo from now on!

Can order anything you want on the sandwich.  Friendly staff.  Very reasonably priced.  Great sandwiches and milkshakes.

Best sandwich I've had in a long time highly recommended

Downtown Centre Cinemas
The perfect place for a first date, night out or just a nice family night. With comfortable seats, wide isles and most of the rows containing reclining chairs... It's a great experience. Decent wine selection and ability to salt and butter your own popcorn is a nice addition as well. Not to mention you can reserve your seating through their website or app (which takes you to their mobile website),  so you don't need to worry about getting there an hour early for a good/new movie.

I was in town over Thanksgiving weekend and believe it or not, saw 3 movies here in 3 days. The ticket prices were way cheaper than mega cinemas I usually go to back home. The food choices were awesome. I think I saw some one with beer. Popcorn was fresh. And the bathrooms were clean. Can't ask for more than that.

This is our favorite theater right now. The lay down recliners are amazing. Book early because they sell out. You can get beer or wine and take it into any theater. I also love the soda machine with like 200 possible combinations.

They've definitely improved this place a lot. The new seating is great, even if you can't get a recliner the rockers are nice. They've added wine and beer. It's pricey, but still nice to have. They have a few more food options like pretzels (which I love) hopefully they'll add some more food soon. I'd recommend buying your tickets online especially for a newer movie. It's convenient and the good seats fill up early.

This place is fantastic! Employees all seem to like working there. The seats in the theatres are super comfortable! We always plan ahead so we can use the recliners!  Perfect for a date night or for taking your family to a show! Going there really makes "the movie experience" a better one!

Sunbeam Motel, San Luis Obispo
Awesome motor inn...  The only complaint I had was that the AC unit was loud, but it was pretty effective and I guess that's what matters.  Room was pretty clean, although the coffee make had dried up coffee in the pot (yick).  For the price and charm, though, it can't be beat.

Rooms were a bit dated and run down. Nooks and crannies were dusty/dirty, the microwave turntable didn't turn and the mini-fridge had a broken temperature knob. However, sheets and towels were clean and we didn't find any bugs. So for the cost ($48 per night), it was decent.

This is one of the best Motels I've stayed in at such a low price. The owners are wonderful. We had just moved here and we we're looking for housing so we actually stayed here a month. It's quiet, rooms are nice and clean bed was soooo comfortable. There was a microwave and refridgerator in the room. It was close to stores, restaurants and the freeway. I will always stay here when I need to because that's how much I liked it.

Very pleasant owner/mgr. Comfortable bed, clean sheets/towels. Damaged cab drawers, dirty shower curtain, cobwebs in windowsill, mixed feelings.
 Very convenient location plus non-chain business. Easy to reserve by email/phone.

Always friendly and clean. Walking distance to downtown and great value!  Our fav place to stay!

Sands Inn & Suites
Neat and clean rooms. Have hot breakfast with a waffles maker eggs n sausage along with some cookies n fruit juices. Overall if you are paying about $70 worth it. Is near enough to freeway without being noisy

First time visiting Sands Inn located in San Luis Obispo Ca. I was very impressed overall with this hotel. Very clean for the price I paid. Marcus at the  front desk registration was very nice and made me feel welcomed when I first walked in. Keep up the good work this is a great hotel to stay at if your in San Luis Obispo Ca

Very great hotel. We stay 1 night after labor day weekend in Pismo Beach area. This hotel has amazing employees with excellent customer service. 

The breakfast was delicious and was included. From eggs and sausage, to fresh fruit and yogurt, cereals and pastries, juices/coffee, and more. The rooms were very clean and spacious. Nice pool, workout room (a bit small) but more than adequate. Both which close at 10 pm. 

Every staff member I encountered was a pleasant experience. Even the lovely lady that waved as we drove off. I will most definitely be returning when in this area. Thank you all the staff and employees including room service for simply being awesome. God bless you.

My girlfriend and I were forced to leave our home in Ojai due to the recent wildfires, and the staff here at Sands could not have been any nicer! There was a whole group of us coming from Ojai and they welcomed us with open arms. They lowered the rate and waived any dog fee, saying that we were welcome to stay as long as we needed to. They had a BBQ and wine tasting event by the pool for all the evacuees, with live music and a lot of love and gratitude in the air. It was very special and I recommend it to anyone looking for a friendly inexpensive place to stay. Thank you Matt!

The hotel is in a great location near bars and restaurants. The room was very clean and spacious. Great customer service! Housekeeping was excellent!

Peach Tree Inn
Very pleasant, relaxed location with very friendly and helpful staff. Clean room. Nice lounging chairs at the back porch and under a shady tree, great for reading and relaxing. There's also a swing hanging from another tree. Nice mountain views. Continental breakfast.

We stayed here for a night and loved it. It was much nicer than some of the places we've stayed in our California trip. The rooms were clean, staff friendly and helpful and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent!

Amazing cute little place, awesome staff and just a cozy cute feel. The breakfast was awesome too.

I love this place! Amazing atmosphere, nice lady working in the front, complimentary breakfast, lots of options, good sized rooms, there's backyards in some of them, and also there's a really cool swing hanging on a tree that you can go on. Definitely would come back here. Only complaint is that sometimes there's not enough space in the breakfast lounge.

Great stay!  Friendly staff!  Good rates!  The area is comfortable, safe and quiet!  We stay here whenever we're in SLO.

Quality Suites Downtown San Luis Obispo
One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Everything was top notch. Excellent property in every single way.

The rooms are spacious, well-equipped, and quality. The bed is especially comfortable. The staff is friendly, and there are daily events. The common areas are also very nice. My only issue was that the walls in my room were too thin letting in too much noise from the outside, adjacent rooms, and the ten ton gorilla staying above me that got up at 4am. Very nice, but noisy place.

Amazing: complementary alcohol (805 beer & wine) for happy hour (2 hours). They bbq dinner and it‚Äôs cheap. Dvds to watch and complementary made-to-order breakfast.
Also shuttles to downtown for dinner if you wish
You may pay a little more to stay there but you will save the money on these things!

The hotel is older but very well taken care of. The service and grounds were fantastic!  Best breakfast area ever!

everything is perfect! We travel from SF to LA. And this is the perfect mid point hotel! Everything is clean and service is excellent. They have pool and hot water tub. Free Great breakfast with cook dish. We really enjoy our stay here! If possible, we will definitely revisit!!

Mother's Tavern
Love Mother's. Great drinks and always a great time!

Had a weird experience at this bar, visiting town with my sisters and we presented our IDs but the bartender was flabbergasted. He looked them over and then disappeared with our IDs to a back room...never had this happen at a bar ever. When he returned with our IDs he tried to joke unsuccessfully about them possibly being fake IDs because they all had the same last name(??)... after basically accusing us of using fake IDs. He handled the situation extremely poorly and definitely did not make us feel welcome or apologize for the accusations...so we ordered one drink and then wished we hadn't since we were totally ignored once we ordered so off we went...

Nice atmosphere, great place to enjoy the farmer's market food and still eat with the comforts of a restaurant. Tri tip was wonderful. 

Nice Place for Late Lunch and a Pint

We came here in the later afternoon for a late lunch. Ordered the fish and chips at $14.95 each; they're delicious! Also had a pint of the IPA: wonderful stuff. 

It wasn't crowded when we went so we found the ambience quite chill. Friendly wait staff. 

One of the go-to night spots in SLO if you want to party with the college aged crowd.  Get there early if you don't want to pay cover.  Drinks are expensive (as compared to some other places in town) so don't be surprised.  The place gets pretty messy as the night goes on and dancing usually starts on the main floor, as disastrous as it is.

========================================================
SLO Provisions
Walked in on a whim. Glad we did. Food was excellent! Will definitely be back.

Always so amazing but my favorite is the chicken dinner special. 

Definitely order the chicken. 

Oh and they pull an excellent espresso shot, too. 

Steve and Dwyne have a fabulous selection of yummies here. Don't miss it!

Everything here is so good! Soups, deli salads, sandwiches, etc. My favorites are their daily meat specials (brisket, porchetta), rotisserie chicken, and their quiche is fantastic!!

Nice friendly staff, cute location and most importantly wonderful food! I usually get mine to go and it's like having a meal cooked just for me. They also have some wonderful local goods, yes cocktail is a must try.

Palo Mesa Pizza III
Polo Mesa pizza in San Luis Obispo is hands down the best pizza in the Central Coast Gaby And the staff are really friendly and they make sure that there pizza is always at it‚Äôs absolute best quality two thumbs way up üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ

Best pizza in town.  When the office buys lunch, this is a favorite!  Thai pizza is so good!  Crust is tasty!

This place genuinely impressed me. I was surprised at how good the pizza was. The dough is extremely tasty and they have great calzones as well. The staff was very friendly. Definitely recommend. 

Simply the best pizza in town.  Nothing too crazy, just quality ingredients and a great dough.

Awesome pizza. They even have a good gluten free crust.

========================================================
Pizza Solo
I was extremely excited to order Pizza Solo for an office lunch after having it at Farmers Market.  Pizza Solo is my go to meal when I attend Farmers.

My initial interaction was good, I called the night before my work event and the gentleman on the phone was very polite.  He instructed me that it would be best to call back in the morning.  Because they don't open until 11am and it was a large order that would need to be delivered by 12pm I was concerned about not ordering the night before.  He reassured me that he would be in early the next day at 10am to take my order.

I called 4 times the next morning starting at 10am, no answer.  At 10:45 I was finally forced to place my order with another restaurant to ensure I had food for my meeting.

Tasty pizza! I ordered a large Thai Pie and split it with my fiance. We both had 4 slices and it ended up being pretty filling. I'm not usually a fan of thin pizza because they sometimes don't fill me up, but this one did the trick and i really liked the crust. Not too bad for $15, I recommend it.

Great pizza place downtown. Outdoor sitting lets you people watch while you have good pizza. I've been coming here for over 10 years and I highly recommend it!

Bought a pepperoni pizza. The Solo size. Spent about 9 bucks. The marinara sauce was wattery. The cheese and pepperoni were sliding off the pizza. If you enjoy holding down the toppings on your slice or holding your slice like a taco so everything stays, this might be the place for you. Otherwise just get one of their overpriced salads or go elsewhere for pizza.

Crust tasted like actual cardboard . Not exaggerating.. and cheese fell off completly . It is pretty cheap but the sizes are off

========================================================
Courtyard by Marriott San Luis Obispo
Nice new and clean hotel.  The staff is great and happy to help with whatever you need. Food is good but they used to have a buffet breakfast that included more variety and was  very fast.  Now it is a walk up with less options and takes a little longer.

Quiet little place in a good area. Rooms are cozy and very spacious. Nice pool and spa area. Love the bar and people are super friendly

Although recently remodeled, the management does not measure up to the interior.  Our hairdryer and television never worked during our 4 day stay, despite being reported. Our floor was vacuumed once even though there was a need for it much sooner.  I am a fan of Marriott but this particular property is one we will pass on next time.

Worst experience ever at a Marriott. First the room we stayed in had a pee stained overnight underwear thing in the drawers that house keeping missed and hair all over the shower. Then they switched our rooms and the second room we got was infested with ants. Maintenance came up and sprayed but that doesn't change the fact that they should be keeping up on that. Last I get back to the hotel and our key doesn't work! Had to walk all the way to the other side of the hotel with my little ones and the lady the desk "can't find any room" with the name we gave her. After 5-10 minutes with no change or spelling to the name she magically found it. I mean come one there should be better guest services both with front desk and house keeping! We are also Elite members and I expected them to take better care of us.

On a positive  note: towels are soft and water pressure in shower is good.

Stayed with my husband and kiddos (1&3) staff was all very friendly. Loved the room set up. Bistro had good food. Not one complaint.

========================================================
Motel 6 San Luis Obispo North
I enjoyed my stay staff has good customer service. My room was clean. I would recommend a update to the website when you book a room to show the price with taxes not before taxes.

My husband went into check in because the reservation was under his name and then they had me come in and give my ID. They were very friendly at the front desk, everyone was very friendly. We walked into the room and it smelled good. We stayed for 3 nights and had a pleasant experience. We will be back

Pretty good stay though was disappointed there wasn't a fridge or hair dryer. The sink and tub had hair in it from previous stay which was gross. But for the price I was satisfied with my main needs (comfy bed, shower, and tv).

Everyone  was friendly  at the front  desk. The room was clean and actually smelled good unlike a lot of motels. It didn't have carpet and I think it helps to keep  clean. I had to ask for more towels and they gave them to me at the front desk with no hassle.

Room was clean.  Bathroom cleanliness was above average compared to other Motel 6 motels I have stood at.  Walls are paper thin, or we were put in a connecting room - not sure which one.  

Our neighbor came in at about 2am and it literally sounded like they were in our room.  

Front office staff was great.

========================================================
Los Padres Inn
Love it, love it, love it!  Simple, very clean, comfortable, affordable, safe.  I really appreciated being able to open the windows for fresh air.  Super convenient to down town, historic sites, shops, parks.  Easy, 20-minute walk from the train station.  Run as a family business--all were very helpful and friendly, yet unobtrusive.  Great cafe right next door, and restaurants all up and down the street.  This is a jewel of a motel.

Pretty good hotel. Very close to everything. The woman at the front desk was very nice :) It isn't the world's most amazing hotel, but has everything you will need. For a place to stay that is safe and quiet, this is your place. Good for the value.

It is a cozy place. A little outdated but cute. The only downside is the shower. Im 5'8" and the shower head was right at my chest.

Good value for what you pay for.
There is no aircon, but you don't need it here. Instead you'd need the heater, that the room has.
It's clean, quiet and has all necessities. There are several options for a quick bite within 2 minute walking

Clean, free parking, very good location, has free WiFi. 
The room was very basic, does not include breakfast. 

========================================================
Round Table Pizza
Food was good. Service was awesome, and staff were friendly, but many tables had food crumbs and needed to be cleaned. 

I went to the round table and slow today for lunch pretty good food but the only thing I don't like was there is no names of the pizzas like the King Arthur Hawaiian pepperoni there was no names it's just put on the buffets  plus their iced tea was hot and nasty

Great food, we order regularly on Saturdays. But not open til 10 on Fridays as advertised online. They actually close at 9.

I love round table pizza. I went to the San Luis Obispo restaurant for the first time and brought my wife there too. She had never had a Round Table pizza before and I wanted her to try it. We went for the lunch special. We both put lots of Parmesan cheese on top of our pizzas and the pizza was pretty good. Just as I had finished, my wife noticed a black  bug that was about a half inch to an inch long inside the Parmesan cheese shaker. The bug was alive and pretty active in the cheese. I took the shaker to the manager and she said it was pretty disgusting. My wife didn't want to finish the last slice of her pizza and I didn't want it either after what I saw.  The manager said it was a "pincher" bug and they were all over San Luis. She said they sprayed every month but the area was infested with them. I kept wondering if they lay eggs in the cheese that we liberally  sprinkle out over the pizzas. It could have happened to any restaurant I suppose, but it left a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively that is).

It is what it is...Round Table. Nice employees and clean restaurant.

========================================================
Mama's Meatball
We were staying for the holiday weekend and were craving Italian food. We found this restaurant through Yelp and were s bit disappointed. The garlic knots were dry and the spaghetti sauce to acidic. The linguine with shrimp and pesto was too salty. What I do recommend is the beet salad and chicken lasagna with pesto beschamel sauce. Both dishes were hands down delicious!!  Service was wonderful too!!

Everything was fresh, tasty, and timely. Our waitress, Angela, was great and the environment was too. Everything was very clean as well with a pleasant ambiance. The servings are not large, but not too small either. Overall a great experience.

Best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had!  Attentive wait staff and great atmosphere.  We'll definitely go back!

This is my wife and I's first date spot, and it's where we went for our first dinner as newlyweds. It has always been our "go to" spot. Great food, warm atmosphere, polite knowledgeable staff and a modest bill at the end of the night are a winning formula for one of the best restaurants in SLO!

Great food. Very friendly service. Everyone worked together to make our night wonderful. Thanks!!! I saw another review that marked this restaurant down because they couldn't  find parking. Sad to say some people just need drive there Hyundai to Taco Bell and keep eating there. Never come into SLO town.

========================================================
Sunset Drive-In
The last of its kind! We always have an amazing time here the entrance fee for two movies is ridiculously low. The concession stand is Affordable and staff is very helpful.

This has been a favorite since my childhood and I'm also glad it's still open since they are so rare these days. Used to be one price per car, now it's priced per person. Kids movie always plays first, and the more adult movie plays second, with about a 20 minute intermission. Small concession stand with snacks, and restrooms.

Loved it! Delicious nachos! And real butter on their popcorn! Plus they have a really cute girl making them!

Great drive-in to see new release movies. Great food and service. Always nice.

2 movies, 9.00 an adult, no one talking behind you, whats not to love at the Drive-in. We go at least once a month, sometimes more during the summer blockbuster movie run. Grounds are kept clean.  Snack bar offers some common yummy snacks like popcorn, soda, candy, and nachos. Love their nachos! Good prices and free refills on popcorn and drinks. Family owned and operated, family friendly, never had a problem. Free jumps at the end of the night if your battery should die. Radios to rent if you don't have one. Screen large and picture quality good. Minor complaints, bathrooms need upgrading and once in awhile you'll smell pot, but other then that, love going their with my family.

========================================================
Panda Express
I visited on 2/2/18. The food was hot and fresh and the service was friendly. Be aware that it can get a little busy around the lunch time and there may be a line. Over all Good experience I‚Äôll be back.

This location is always great. They always have fresh food, and the service is very quick. They keep the dining room very clean as well.

This place gets too busy during lunch for only average food but worth stopping if the line isn't out the door!

My friends and I love traveling to Panda on the weekends for a quick meal. They always have for prepared and everything is quite clean. Sure it may not be as lovely as standard pandas but it is still a great place to hang out!

While the staff was extremely nice it was frustrating to know that the online order I placed still wasn't ready when I arrived when they stated it would be ready. To add insult to injury I got a smaller than normal portion of the item that caused the delay. 

Just frustrates me that instead of asking to wait 2-3 more minutes for a regular sized portion they pulled those pieces that were first done, shorted my order, all just to get me out of there 2 minutes faster (I already waited 15...17 minutes isn't that big of a difference)

========================================================
Americas Best Value Inn San Luis Obispo
We stayed October 28-29. Jacob is the best at the check in desk. Please keep him. He checked in several customers and never lost his great personality. This place is a little dated but very comfortable, cozy, very clean. Close to nice eating spots. Breakfast perfect just enough to get you going, the waffles to die for. We want to do what we can to bring up the review score because this is really a nice non pet friendly place. We booked all the way up to 2018, yes we and others we know will return.

If there was a way to rate them with Negative stars i would! The owner was nasty & customer service was HORRIBLE. Its almost like they don't have housekeeping because the rooms are disgusting. I do not reccomend you stay here for ANY reason. If desperate...I'd rather stay in my car and wash up in a public restroom. 
I can't believe this place is an open and operating business. Appalling!!

My family and I stayed here while we moved our oldest son into his dorm room. All hotels in the area price gouge and fill up fast for move in weekend. We paid over $200 per night. Filthiest hotel room I've ever stayed in. When I spoke with front desk staff regarding the lack of cleanliness, they gave me a handful of stained rags to go clean the room myself. Do yourself a favor-don't ever stay here!

This was the worst motel experience I have had - that includes stays in third world countries. Starting with front desk staff that seemed they would rather be having a root canal than checking me in, to the bathroom door knob that fell off, to long hair on the towels, to stains on the carpet, to the shower rod that sagged, and the air conditioner that didn't, this was a motel that was worth $50 per night but charged 4x that amount on weekends. I definitely would not recommend this place to people that I like.

Terrible place.  Prepaid the room for two nights.  Went to check in late at night and they  wanted $20.00 for late check  in. It says nothing about this on the web site. When I said i was going to leave a bad review about this, he refused to give me and my pregnant wife a room at 1.30 at night even tho it was pre paid.

========================================================
Lexington Inn - San Luis Obispo
Clean but old place.  Front desk unfriendly and not helpful. TV broken. And when you ask for help. First they say they will come and help but never show up. Then they say oh we know and we will fix it in the future. No sorry, no excuse.. Very disappointing place..

Pool wasn't well maintained, and hot tub had large water beetles that lived inside of the jets (probably why they didn't work). Breakfast wasn't great but wasn't the worst. Overall alright experience, but would probably recommend looking elsewhere if continental breakfast and hot tubs are big selling points for you when picking a place to stay.

The staff were amazing, especially Diana. I appreciate the pool and fitness room too. It is a minor point, but i wish that the treadmill did not feel so "delicate". It could stand to be replaced. But other than that, we really enjoyed our stay! I will definitely stay here again if I'm in town.

I have stayed here about 3 times a year for the past 6 years. The accommodations themselves are fantastic, with large rooms that are well cleaned. The front-desk staff... not so much. The last few staff members I've spoken with or interacted with in 2017 have been inept, slow and inefficient, rude, repetitive, plus a woman who tried to explain to me that my experiences with the hotel couldn't possibly be real. Overall, each interaction has left a bad taste in my mouth. Won't be back.

Comfortable bed, clean, reasonably quiet. Hot tub didn't work but was a comfortable temperature at least. 

Mini fridge in the room was a nice amenity.

========================================================
Dream Dinners
This place is great for two working parents. In about an hour and a half we make a freezer full of dinners for the month. We spend less money on groceries and eating out. 

Great concept. Very nice staff.

The statement that "My Husband is becoming a great cook", both terrifies me & makes me proud :)  I am sure that they can teach us more.
Thanks!

Love love Dream dinners, Lauren is awesome and the fact that she will prepare and bring the dinners to our house is an added blessing to us.  The dinners are great and my husband is becoming a great cook.  Thanks again Lauren for these great meals.

I have been using Dream Dinners for over a year now. I love the convenience of being able to prepare meals, take them home and then cook them as needed. Perfect for busy couples who do not always have time to make an entire meal. I usually make a side veggie/salad and some other side (spuds, rice or pasta, ect) to go along with the meal. My fave meals: Pub Style Chicken, Parmesan Crusted Chicken, and Arroz Con Pollo. The only draw back is that meals with beef tend to be more expensive. 

========================================================
Kona's Deli
What can I say about my favorite sandwich place in San Luis Obispo? Everything is fresh. The serving sizes are generous. I've never been disappointed.

Awesome sandwiches and has an outside patio as well....great atmosphere and you get to watch your food get made and pick/select whatever you like...They also have great specials :)

Great Kona Klub sandwich

This deli is delicious and has a great vibe! My favorite is sandwhich #17, the "destroyer". Great place!

Great sandwhiches, friendly staff, quick service

Domino's Pizza
i order all the time but other day my delivery driver came crying to my houuse because she forgot my drink,she kept offering to drive to 7/11 to buy me one i told her it was fine because she said she would tell them and i would ge ta soda or pizza on next delivery. and on my next delivery i asked and they said i would have had to complain the night of....

Odered the pizza at 6:15. Told me it was delivered at 7:05.  Called to speak to manager, Stephanie, she hung up on me because I complained.  Called back and spoke with her, this time she new not to say anything because I could be recording her.  DIdn't receive pizza until 8:05, cold.  Something needs to change

The food is good I‚Äôm not going to lie to be honest one of my favorites, but actually today I was looking with detail how the make the pizzas and the lady was not wearing gloves, the sleeves of her windbreaker was touching the pizza, she was rubbing her nose while making the pizza, and to top it off she went outside and smoked a cigarette without gloves so her fingers wouldn‚Äôt smell like tabacco, I ain‚Äôt going back there again!

I've never had an issue with this Domino's...the employees are friendly. Delivery drivers are on time. The pan pizzas are good, so is the cheesy bread.

This is the only pizza store that I found that worked on Christmas Day in San Luis Obispo. That's quite amazing! I highly value the wonderful employees in this pizzeria. The quality of food is great, and the wait is standard 15 minutes. You can also order delivery, but that may take around an hour depending on the day and the numbed of employees. What I was amazed to find out was that it works up to 3am! Definitely worth the five stars.üëç

Princess Packers
I had Kevin sundberg,Sam Martin and Javin Harrison move me today and they were super professional and very hard working!! They moved my whole house in 3 hours.i highly recommend meathead movers if you want your job done fast and the right way!

========================================================
Taco Bell
The food is good. The same as any other Taco Bell but the bathrooms are co-ed and are pretty gross. Instead of the ladies room being relatively clean they're brought down to the level of the men's room now which is bad yuck

Never ever have a problem at Taco Bell. Love there $5.00 Box meals, but the $1.00 Stackers are it!

Great food great staff always a great place to eat at

I absolutely loved my visit, best Taco Bell I've ever been to! The food was amazing, hats off to this talented cook! He was so cool and welcoming. I will be eating at this Taco Bell whenever I can. I'll proudly bring my whole family next time!

Decent place but can be very busy, especially after 11pm

========================================================
Crossroads Video
This place should have gone out of business long ago, yet somehow the owners mange to keep it open. They will shutdown soon. Great selection of movies.

Perfect little slice of nostalgia. Plenty of movie options, and if they don't have it then they'll get it. Definitely worth your time and money.

The moat selection of movies in SLO county, and great service

FUN to go to old movie rental stores

San Luis Obispo's last video store. Tons of great movies.

Meathead Movers
Charges go up allllll the time but that‚Äôs the literal price you pay for the only decent storage in slo. Very safe. Very clean. Friendly. The units get very! very!hot!! your stuff can/will get ruined and they will not obviously take care of that‚Äî-even though they never tell you to actually be aware of that in slo which really doesn‚Äôt get that hot‚Äî-this unit warped thick rubber, badly‚Äîif that is an idea how hot they get. But again, safe and clean and still worth it.

We had Jason and Gabriel we're so helpful. They came in and picked up my stuff and moved it to my new house very quickly. They took the doors off to get my fridge through undamaged. In addition they were supper friendly and very professional. I would highly recommend Meathead Movers!

Great customer service offering out of state options for managing your unit. The staff is always very friendly and helpful. 

I have had terrible and unpleasant experiences in the past and have never really wanted tobwate my time or energy to sit down and write a review. Both wich are extremely valuable to me. I also believe that sometimes companies need to be given the benefit of the doubt. In this case we tried, and tried with no success. Their workers Damaged a NEW Appliance and denied that they were at fault. Not only did i see them trying to move the appliance out of a door that it did not fit through. I also had to help them take it appart before they did any more damage. They then continued to do more damage in the area. They game me a phone  number for claims. They said they would investigate and get back to us. It took weeks before we decided to call before they told us they were still investigating. Weeks after that we received a letter that denied the claim. As a business owner myself. It is hard to understand how they are still in business. If you have items you care about. I would look elsewhere. Or make sure they send you prople with some common sence.

I was very nervous when my husband booked this company because I've had multiple bad experiences with local companies, but Chase and Kade from Meathead Movers were absolutely amazing. Not only did they work their butt off, but were incredibly professional and took great care with our belongings. We had one issue with the apolstry on the chair becoming damaged, but it was quickly resolved where we did feel like it was going to be a long huge hassle that we couldn't attend to during our stressful move. If this is a reflection of how all their interactions go with customers, I only wish Meathead was available for all our moves to come (we are a military family).

========================================================
Blaze Pizza
Great when there's enough staff, otherwise it takes 20 minutes just to get your pizza assembled and another 10 to get it baked. Maybe the cashier will decide to count the cash in the register or sweep the floor when you are standing there waiting to pay, for 10 more minutes.  When it's not busy, they're out of sauces, cheese, toppings, and drinks. Seems like the employees have no clue what they're doing. I'd come here again only if I ordered ahead and the employees weren't slacking off. 

Total time to get pizza: 30 minutes

This is hands down the best tasting and most customizable pizza I have ever had. Fast and friendly service even when the restaurant is packed.

This is like Subway for Pizza! Its an awesome way to get the pizza you want with an affordable price point!  The staff are friendly and the food is delicious.  They have gluten free options. And a verity of toppings and sauce.  IF your into spending $30.00 bucks for your pizza this is not for you; but if you like to walk in with $10.00 bucks and walk out with a dollar in  your pocket and a pizza give it a shot! Warning!!!..its addictive!

Highly enjoyed this build your own pizza place! We had a fantastic conversation with the staff which resulted with us accidentally taking the wrong pizza. They fixed it up and sent me on my way with a coupon for a free pizza later. I highly recommend this place for a good pie !

Blaze is great if you go when it is not busy. Otherwise, the pizza's come out burnt, the line is slow and place is a mess. But for 8.00 you get a 12 inch personalized pizza with as much toppings as you can coax the employees into giving you. It is also a hit or miss weather they have the toppings you want. I went on Sunday and no chopped tomatoes, time before that, out of pesto sauce. The time before that my husbands pizza came out burnt. When he took it back to complain they made a big deal about remaking his pizza and told him he would have to go to the back of the line. However, someone else stepped in and moved him to the make line and remade the pizza. It seems like they have a high staff turn over rate. Every time I've gone in there, there are tons of employees but no faces I recognize from the time before. They are now carrying a new soda, which I love, made with cane sugar. So if you can avoid the crowd, get a your pizza without getting it burned, for 8 bucks it's not to bad to sit out on the patio and get some sunshine.

Panda Express
Poor service, inexperienced staff, dried out food I mean the usual thing at a Panda Express but dang. One star we'll deserved.!

Great food in a convienient location. Not much of a wait prior to getting served

Boy oh boy is this a great place to go if you want to have anything that is fried like: Fried chicken, fried pork, fried rolled things. If you're looking for a place to have organic traditional Chinese food this is not the place, but if you need a filling lunch that you will feel later than go to panda.

Good food a little pricey

Typical Panda, but pretty good.  Nice staff.

Pro Moving
Pro Moving did an excellent job moving my family's belonging when we moved last summer!  Rob, the owner, took time to understand the job and made sure he's competent staff was aware of our needs.  We moved items into storage and other items into a new home.  They asked lots of questions and double checked to make sure everything was moved safely and to the right place!  Pro Moving was affordable and paid attention to details which I appreciated.  I would highly recommend them to anyone needing a local moving company.  I'll definitely use them again in the future!

I have spoken with the manager here. He is an absolute piece of garbage. Refused service to me when I never planned on using his service in the first place. Gave me a quote 6-7x the figure I have seen on the internet for this type of shipping. What am I supposed to pay your rent for 3 months for a 2 day job? Get out of here dude you are garbage. If you are going to act like that then I am going to use my first amendment right to free speech to tell people planning to use your business what you are all about. This dude is scum.

The movin crew was fanrastic and professional. They packed and move my home furniture and belongings with care. I recommend pro movers! You will not be disappointed. The were on time and packed and loaded my belongings in a timel matter. They put unpacked with care placing each item as directed. Great guys!! Thank you for a stress free day!!! Matt

Working with Robert helped me sooo much he helped sort pack and was totally efficient price was complexly reasonable and I would work with his company again

SCAM!!! DON'T USE THIS COMPANY. They are NOT professional at all. We had to load and unload our stuff. He wanted payment before the job was done and won't give us our stuff until he got paid.

Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
Always quality in this chain, salads and soups are great as usual. Service was excellent and we enjoyed the experience here. Pleasant atmosphere was a plus for us and all rooms seemed welcoming.

The staff is actually great with wine pairings and helping you choose something based on a flavor or food restrictions!! GF options and good drink selections! Hardly ever a wait or line.

Food is usually good, lots of breadsticks and salad, service this time was good. It can get very loud. Drinks are good.

Jarred the bartender provided a phenomenal experience.  I have been to many different Olive Garden locations and this customer service surpassed my expectations.  Jarred is extremely attentive and knowledgeable.  Thanks so much!

My girlfriend loves this place. They have a very nice free wine sample you can try. Good pricing. I would recommend it to a friend

If you havent had the chance to experience this deliciously amazing treat, i highly recommend you do! Your welcome! üòÅ

great value. love the fact it's outside instead of inside like most other locations.

Seriously inexpensive giant pizza. Cheese, pepperoni or combo. And, it's really good!

At Costco in San Luis Obispo and the food court is closed.
Are they remodeling?

Jersey Mike's Subs
WOW. That's all I can say about the food and service at this place. Not only was the food , hot , delicious and high-quality , but the service was truly fast and  exceptional. The attitude of the entire the crew was right on from start to finish that made my experience very pleasant, hospitable and comfortable. The manager surprised me by bringing the food hot and ready to me personally while I was expecting my name to be  to be called to the pick up window. Kudos Manager scott! Good job.

Probably should stick to Jersey.  We have so many great local sandwich shops within about a mile I don't know why anyone would indulge this crappy chain. My wife first tried it on a wine tasting trip through Edna Valley and said it was terrible, I was reluctant to believe it.  I mean sandwiches are relatively easy right?!  Wrong.  After giving this place two chances on bike rides through Edna Valley it is terrible.  The people are generally nice, hence the 2 stars.  But damn if you want an East coast sandwich drive a mile down Broad and go to the Grinder.  The sandwiches here are Subway standard maybe slightly better.  Wanted to doubt what I'd heard but turned out true.  Only reason this place might last is due to having a decent location with good employees.

I used to always order  the#8 sandwich off the app once, sometimes twice during the work week. There's a location a couple of miles from my office and I'd go pick it up, bring it back and have time to enjoy it on my break. The #8 comes with bacon, but for the last several visits, they've forgotten to include it. So I attempted to adjust my order and add "extra bacon" to see if that would help. That only work once and for the last 3 consecutive visits, no bacon and no extra vinegar which I always request. After these failed attempts, I gave them another try and chose a later time like 2pm for lunch pickup. Maybe it's getting forgotten during a rush. So, I went in at 215 for my 2pm pick up and not only was it not ready; it hadn't even been started; and there were no customers in line! So I sat down, checked messages, but upin near completion, of my sandwich, I had to remind them about the bacon & vinegar. This is super diappointing, because I love Jersey Mike's and am happy to pay double if it were just made correctly! I used to spend about $30 or more a week, but now, I don't even consider this location an option for a lunch break. Unless I go in on a weekend when I plenty of time to kill, I won't be returning. I've given this location many, many chances, but to no avail.

Best cheese steak on the Central Coast. Friendly staff and clean facility.

Top quality subs. Helpful staff. Meats cut fresh for each sandwich. 

Recommend #13 (Italian) with some pepper relish for that East Coast vibe.

Foremost Wine Company
Great concept, awful execution. Really short wine list given the name of the place and doesn‚Äôt even highlight local wines. We waited 45 min and didn‚Äôt even receive the salad and olives we ordered. Food was fine, but inattentive staff and lackluster wines make this place a must-miss!

For a fancy place they've seriously been dropping the ball lately. The food is excellent, no question, but you have to doubt if you're going to even get what you ordered.

We reserved the wine room on a Friday night for dinner for 16. They forgot that Friday night (during family weekend in a college town) might be busy.

We never got our hors d'oeuvres. I had to cancel‚Äã those after an hour after they served the mains. There was no organization all. The guys that delivered plates were great. Whoever directed them, I don't know.

Everyone kept a separate tab at the wine bar because you couldn't get one at your table.

 (Hey Foremost, you should maybe have a whiskey or other liquor if you are going to have people standing around doing nothing waiting for nonexistent waitstaff.)

That is dumb.

-TBone

We did not get half our order and our server seemed surprised. The worst dining experience in a very long time.

I'm impressed. The curried cauliflower was unique and delicious and the hanger steak was great. The potatoes could have been more flavorful, but overall a great dinner.

Big wine bar and restaurant that has a lot of great places to sit, eat, and relax. Owned by Tooth and Nail winery but they pour other wines as well.

Slo Self Storage
I've dealt with the people who run this facility for many years and used to recommend them many time a week to my customers.
 I went in one day to rent a UHAUL for a customer and as soon as I opened my mouth, the lady who runs the place told me ( very loudly in front of another customer) that she didn't want my business, or me in there, any more. It seems that she became friends with a competitor of mine and decided to do business with him.
 She was very rude to me in front of her customers. I've seen her be the same way to many customers over the years. Even after the rats in their units destroyed the furniture of my customers. Never wanting to apologize or make things right with the people who lost their belongings to Rat Damage.
 Alamo storage has the same problems.

Lots of clean small (and larger) units available for reservation. We are using them again this year to store college gear over the summer. U-haul on site even rents to under 24 year olds...

Well as far as I can say I love it here great costumer service and if you complain about it, it's a storage place just pick what you need and store it. And money wise drop it off in the box after hours. I have no negative nor bad things about this place.

I've never used the UHaul services provided by this company but I did use the storage. In the time that I had my items stored at this factuality I had my lock damaged (something crammed into it) as well as had the owners scream at myself and my husband. At one point of going in the owners son attempted to fight  with my husband because we where not aware that they where closed (no signs posted,  we where there during regular business hours).  The last time I visited my unit I needed to speak with the owners and we had to wait for half an hour for them to show up because they ran to the bank without placing a notice on the door (this occurred during normal business hours as well).  Very bad customer service from this organization.

Owners are very rude. It'd best to find a storage unit else where unless you like to be screamed at by white trash.

San Luis Obispo Railroad Museum
Great little museum! My son LOVED it. It was only $3 to get in and totally worth it! The model train area is not complete... But as with most model train areas it will probably never be truly done! They will always be working on something! It was all decorated for Christmas so it was very pretty! Loved it!

Love this place would recommend for all ages very friendly very helpful The trains that they have on the tracks are pretty cool to see

Small that took about 30-45 mins to visit. Exhibits should be better maintained, specially when there are so few. The 1920s train car is the best exhibit, but it really need some TLC and please stop using different areas of the car as storage for old boxes.

Small, local RR Museum. Done a good job within the limits of their facility and funds. Focus is exclusively on the Central Coast of CA.

We went on a tour this Wednesday. The people who attended us were excellent. They really care for Railroad history. Thank you

Penske Truck Rental
The agent running this Wouldn't accept a paper AAA card, claiming it had to be plastic and swipable which added 70$ to my total. I was. It aware AAA made plastic cards as I have always had paper.. on top of that I declined all insurance when I ordered online but he added "LDW" for 80$ as I was checking out without any questions.. Will never rent from them again.

Helped when no o e else did.
The guy running the office knows his stuff. 
Quick reliable and professional.
Thank you again

Sandercock Transfer Company
I recommend Sandercock highly; they did a phenomenal job for us!  From start to finish Sandercock facilitated everything perfectly for our complex, two-stage, move.

While significantly less expensive, Sandercock was much more responsive than other companies we contacted.  It was easy to get an estimate (no week(s) long wait for an estimate appointment like some other companies) and they were flexible with the schedule when closing/move dates changed.   

The office staff was professional and friendly.   The estimate was done quickly and all of my questions were answered clearly.  

The crew was friendly, efficient, and polite; they maintained a positive, cheerful attitude while working very hard.  Hallways, floors and doorjambs were covered so that nothing was scratched or damaged.  Furniture, the TV and other Items were wrapped securely and safely.   The entire process went quickly and the crew was responsive regarding furniture placement and set up.   As an added perk, Sandercock provided free wardrobe boxes which made moving the closet as simple as it could possible be.  

I have moved many times, but never felt so positively about the company and crew I worked with.  Sandercock gets my highest possible recommendation!üôÇ üöö

Thanks in advance, Ann Thompson (and estimator "Bill"), for all of your great help, coordination, assistance and logistical support.   Ann really kept the glue going that made this work.  Jane and I really appreciate it, more than you know.   You guys turned a stressful day into a good fun productive day.  The driver, Bill from Oklahoma City, rocked it.  What a nice gentleman!!!   Labor staff was superb.  Really knew how to wrap and package things up tightly, and with care - and get the job done, even when blocked out by the mud-slides on the 101 and a 4 hour delayed start!  They came through, in spades!  There is a reason this firm has been successful since 1872!

Our move was complicated with stuff from 3000 sq feet getting staged in two steps with complicated instructions from a single level home to a four story townhouse.   Nothing was lost or scratched and everything ended up in the designated level (including a stone table to the roof deck and a "ton" of wood used for shop projects (along with the heavy tools of a woodshop)).  
The crew showed up on time, listened, offered good advice about dealing with delicate items (like a large screen TV, oil paintings).  Amazingly, they not only had high energy throughout, but were actually cheerful in doing the heavy lifting.
My wife dealt with the office staff and reported nothing but courtesy and responsiveness to our shifting (in time) need.
I'd give this company five stars, but I'm generally new to Yelp rating and have no similar experience to compare Sandercock to ... so I backed off a notch to perhaps add some realism based on satisfaction.

Palm Theatre
Without a doubt, this is the best movie theater in the galaxy, perhaps the entire universe.  Great staff, legendary popcorn, wonderful flicks that you won't see anywhere else, very reasonable pricing for both the movies and the goodies (which are ridiculously low priced compared to the "regular" theaters). This place is a treasure. Thank you to the owners, Jim and Patty Dee, for the this cinematic cultural oasis called the Palm Theatre!

It's a funky, solar powered theater. Has the best selection of movies that don't aim to be big box office hits. Try it, you'll like it.

Love the Palm Theatre! It's a cool old movie house where you can see a bunch of the movies that you won't find at the big franchise theatres.

Everybody knows the Palm Theatre has the freshest pop corn in town. What they don't know is they also have exceptional ice. Never will your frigid beverage be tainted with low quality ice at the Palm theatre. I practically go to the Palm just for those perfectly angular cubes. What a treat. Wow.

Love the Palm. Always great films and a nice experience talking with others , even strangers, while waiting and we don‚Äôt have to endure terrible commercials just great previews of what‚Äôs to come. Plus popcorn and drinks at a great price!

Buffalo Wild Wings
The first time I went here, the service was so bad, and the server was just rude, but decided to try again. Second time was no better. The service here is absolutely the worst, incredibly rude staff that sits around and chats while we sit there. Don‚Äôt think of asking for anything, because they won‚Äôt bring it to you. The staff seem to have sticks up there butts, and obviously don‚Äôt want to be there. I always tip my servers, but both times were so unpleasant, both servers got nothing. I‚Äôm very easy to please but these people don‚Äôt even try. Don‚Äôt come here.

Came in for a late dinner. We waited for 5 minutes for someone to come and seat us finally. After seeing about 5 employees on their phone and no one come to greet us and give us a seat I decided to grab the managers card and call him. He responded by saying the take out section is closed. I told him we were not there for take out and wanted to take a seat. He responds with I will send someone instead of him coming immediately. As a restaurant owner this is unacceptable. We decided to leave. Thanks for ruining my night. I like buffalo wild wings and hope this gets fixed so it doesn't happen to other people.

We love wings, I love the buffalitos. I hate that every single time we eat BWW we feel sickly afterward and get diarrhea the next day. Different franchise, same results. ‚òπ

Your waiter called me a ‚Äúlittle boy‚Äù after I bought a drink athough I‚Äôm over 21. Then he actually got in my face trying to fight me after I ordered a beer. He just starting yelling at me telling me I can‚Äôt have another beer. I said okay. Then the manager said he‚Äôd call the cops if I didn‚Äôt leave. I‚Äôd just been sitting there waiting. I would definitely think twice about going to this restaraunt. Also very dirty inside

Very friendly service. My daughter's favorite restaurant.  I enjoyed my first visit to Buffalo Wild Wings.

San Luis Obispo Museum of Art
The facility itself is slightly older, but staff inside is very helpful.  Display is always intriguing and facility itself is clean.

They've got some really nice art in here for being a small gallery.  Glad I was able to stop by on my random journey.  Hi take a look and see what's new and interesting.  

First class art and cultural center.

Very small museum, but has a good collection of art to enjoy. Free admission!

Great little place for a quick stop and look around.

Rainbow Auto Body
Professional, easy, and friendly. They answered all my questions. I would definitely return.

Amazing Customer Service!! And a Beautiful and Well done job! 
I was rear ended pretty badly. Insurance company suggested Rainbow auto, so automatically I was a little Leary! This was my first accident and I had no idea what to expect, so I went in there completely defensive! With in two minutes, I was able to breathe again. They took one look at my car, said it wasn't safe to drive, got paper work done and a rental car there with in half an hour, and I was on my way! 

My major concern was that my car was as safe as it was when I bought it! With in exactly a week they did just that! It looked Perfect as well! 

I just want to say that I work with the public and its very nice to see that there are still genuinely kind people out there, especially ones that take pride in what they do! Thanks again for waking me through this, painlessly!

I was in an accident with front end damage. My insurance company recommended Rainbow and I am glad they did! Wonderful workmanship, and great customer service. I will definitely recommend Rainbow Auto Body to anyone that needs it.

I was recommended by a friend to check out Rainbow for vehicle repairs. I live in Atascadero, but decided to make the trek to SLO. From first contact to pick up, John and his staff were professional and courteous. It was great working with a Company that takes pride in their work. A special thank you to Rainbow for making my car look beautiful again! 

We were in the unfortunate situation of having two cars in need of auto body work. John and his gang fixed up both our rides and got them looking great again. They were very communicative and informative during the entire process.  We would go back for additional repairs in a second! 2008 BMW 328i & 2007 Chevy Silverado They also installed aftermarket steel bumpers on my truck, in case that is something you are looking for.

History Center of San Luis Obispo County
This place was highly informative. Very educational and entertaining. I was thoroughly impressed with the history of San Luis Obispo and especially enjoyed hearing the local history of the internment camps that help Japanese Americans. A video was playing in the media room but I was enthralled with all.of the pictures and displays they had. For filling out a brief survey I received a free postcard of my choosing. Plan to visit again with the family

This place is a gem. Highly recommend the short ten history video on the area!!!

New exhibits on the Japanese internment camps and a video of SLO's history are really cool additions to an interesting and free local museum

Very nice staff, great little museum

Fremont Theater
Great venue. Very spacious and comfortable. I have attended many shows there and have never had a bad time.

This venue is quite special. I enjoy the beautiful interior design & all the bands I have seen this far at the Fremont. Great local spot to see a band and meet cool people!

Ah, the old Fremont Theater.  What a terrible waste.   This beautiful old Art Deco beauty should be treated better than she is.  She's run down, rarely used for movies and the staff does their best with what they have (which isn't much).  The problem is the ownership.  They just don't have the money (or maybe the willpower) to fix up the old bird.  The inside is beautiful, but its decayed and derelict, which is such a shame because it's such a cool venue.  I understand there are still performances there but who uses a movie theater just for that?  As the only old theater left in the city, I think its just a shame the way it is.  

I hope things change in the future.

Such a fun place, for kids and adults! The movies may not be Imax, and the concessions are pretty standard fare. But the experience at this theater is so special you won't even notice those things. An architectural gem too. I try to bring the whole family here once every couple months for a weekend matinee. If you haven't had the pleasure of watching a movie at the Fremont yet, definitely do so.

Great experience seeing Shaggy at the beautiful historic Fremont Theatre. Great acoustics for a show and the venue is an intimate setting. No matter where you are, you have a great view of the performer. Might do some good to take a couple rows of seats out as to provide more space for standing audience. Other than that, it's awesome!

It will come as no surprise that they have a lot of paint. The store is fairly well laid out. If you are in a hurry you may be disappointed because it can be a while before you are helped. That being said, the staff is courteous and works as fast as they can.

Staff are knowledgeable and frequently they have promotions that offer discounts which are always welcomed. We have been purchasing Sherwin Williams products for well over 20 years.

They have a good selection of colors and options. But, the real reason to go is the help they give you. They were really good about explaining stuff I had no idea about and giving tips. Plus they have a no VOC option (no Volatile Organic Compounds).

Excellent customer service and beautiful paint colors

Great service. Match my paint perfectly.

Alamo Self Storage
I've dealt with the people who run this facility for many years and used to recommend them many time a week to my customers.
 I went in one day and as soon as I opened my mouth, the fat lady who was there told me that she didn't want my business, or me in there, any more. It seems that she became friends with a competitor of mine and decided to do business with him.
 She had been throwing my business cards away for months and lying about it. I've seen her talk about customers badly. Even after the rats in their units destroyed the furniture of my customers, the owners denied responsibility. Never wanting to apologize or make things right with the people who lost their belongings to Rat Damage.
 SLO Self storage has the same problems.
The owners used to be nice to their customers and business partners, but now they have this young FAT CHICK running the office and pissing people off.

I called and spoke to a very nice woman who said she would hold a 5x7 unit for me until the following Thursday when my daughter could come in and fill out the paperwork. When I called Wednesday to confirm, a man told me that they don't hold units and that there is nothing he could do for me. Bad customer relations and poor communication within the business.

The manager doesn't care what his employees do. If they overcharge you, he will say that he has no proof and won't give you a refund. He just wants to steal your money. Do not use this place.

Quiet, not too busy


I rented a storage unit here for a couple about a year when I moved back to California.

The staff was friendly, price was comparable, and grounds were kept clean.

Browder Painting Co.
Moises and his crew did excellent work.  They were clean, thorough, professional and kept us informed throughout the process.  Would recommend them to anyone and will have them back at our home for more painting in the future.

Things went slower than anticipated, but in the end everything was done completely and correctly. I did appreciate the fact that the crews cleaned up at the end of each day and honoured our privacy.

I would like to give special thanks to Arturo and Refugio for being professional, courteous and helpful. I will miss our friendly chats while they worked.

They painted the outside of our business recently. Very efficient, respectful gentlemen who were considerate of our client's ability to come and go. Great job that was done quickly and with a lot of care.

Javier and Alex did a wonderful painting job on my house interior.  I wanted Javier to be my painter because he had done the exterior 2 years ago.  He is so good that I was willing to wait 1 1/2 months so he could be my painter.  I guess he is pretty in demand.  Alex was absolutely wonderful also.  It was my first time using Alex but I would definitely recommend him too.  They were courteous and professional in every way and genuine nice guys.  They were efficient, neat and tidy, detail oriented and made sure that my house and rug did not get mess up at all.  They even did a few extras that were not part of the job.  Regarding price, I could have gotten a cheaper painter.  However, by using Browder (twice now)  I am guaranteed that the job will be done right and on time; plus they have strict requirements and training for their painters. Also, I don't have to worry about a painter showing up drunk or with a hangover or not showing up at all.  Sorry, but we've all heard those stories or had that experience. Javier, Alex and Browder Painting ROCKS!!!

Very professional and friendly. Excellent work!

A wonderful glimpse into history! Al thank you for your service and the personal guided tour! 

Good venue for craft shows. Could use better interior lighting.

There is some kind of unlisted courtroom housed in this building.. I was sitting on the porch writing and a older man started shoeing at me and he didn't even greet me with his name..

Cuesta Park
Can be really secluded.  Great place to host a company bbq.

Spacious. Creek and large grass area. Outdoor playground area. Dirty bathrooms. Homeless problem. Drunk college kids. Disrespectful language. Children are not respected by other people.

Great area usually not busy.  Creek,  bbqs, tables, nice playground, volleyball court,  & large grass area great for kids or dogs.  Great to get a little peace &  quiet even with freeway just yards away.

Cuesta Park has always been a favorite of mine it has three large distinct barbecue areas for large groups and a very large grassy area with a playground for the kids. The creek is running right now and is a great place for the kids to get their feet wet.

One of the nicest parks in San Luis Obispo in my opinion. The playground is great for kids and usually not very busy. Large picnic area below the playground. Creek runs through the park and has a couple spots where you can go in the water.

Brushworks Painting
I just wanted to say how pleased I am with the paint job Brushworks did on our Higuera Street property. It's absolutely stunning! The owner, as well as the crew, was professional and a pleasure to work with. I will be referring others to you on the future and using you guys again!

They are very sloppy unorganized people , and dont pay there painters on what they agree to do so, I painted for them in 100 degree weather in Paso and did pretty much all the work while the foreman talked on the phone the whole time and i end up getting my check after the job was done nicely and the owner totally scammed me and cutt about $300- $400 out of my pay. Dont hire brushworks very unprofessional and Disrespectful,  thanks..

Loved how easy Wayne and Michael made the whole process.  Good price, excellent crew ... efficient, neat, helpful, considerate and just nice people.  Started work on Tues. and job completed Thurs. morning.  Would highly recommend them.

Sinsheimer Park
The kids area for this park was very recently remodeled. It is absolutely fantastic now. There are great big play structures with many slides and multiple stories. There is a zipline. Bring some old cardboard to slide down the fake grass hill slide.

The new best spot in Slo for active parent/child play! Multiple interactive structures and activities, lots of room even when busy, very clean and safe. Also good central location. Water fountains are filtered water and one even specifically for filling water bottles, very parent friendly park. Zip line, climbing stuff, best slides around town, multiple garbage cans around and tables, we have 3 boys and would recommend this to all. Leaving out a bunch too, go check it out!

GREAT park!! There is something for everyone here. If you get the chance check it out,  best park in the area!

Fun little park with a surprising amount of stuff to do! You can easily lose a couple hours there with kids.

This park was fabulous! They have a artificial grass turf hill to sleddown. There's plenty of cardboard to use as a slide at the park, however if you want to prepare a superslider at home with built in handles that would be awesome! Three turny twisty slides for big kids or brave adults and a couple smaller slides for smaller kids. They also have a zip line!! Im proposing a designated adult park day, lol. 
It would be awesome during the weekdays for homeschool park days. Enjoy!

Cheng Park
Pretty tiny only a couple benches and noisy due to the traffic on 2 sides. I like to walk through and eat lunch but it's nothing special.

Urban Oasis in the hustling/bustling mid-town!


Lacks water & does attract homeless.  The park should have been placed by SLO in old Chinatown proper....instead of on the near forgotten periphery.

A sweet, beautiful oasis in SLO; perfect for Tai Chi Chuan and Qigong!

Spirit Winds Physical Therapy
Spirit Winds staff assess your situation throughly and provide personalized therapy programs. They provide 60 minutes of one to one treatment at each visit. I have been to physical therapy at other places many times, but have never gotten the personal, individual attention provided at Spirit Winds. 

I have a yet to be explained, gradually progressive lower limb neuropathy with bilateral loss of sensation, position sense, and some degree of neuropathic pain present for many years but recently of more trouble causing me to seek advice from my primary care doctor which resulted in some testing, referral to a neurologist (pending) and referral to Spirit winds. 

I am greatly impressed by this facility, primarily staffed and run by young women, as well as a kind older man, versed in various modalities of learning about, recording, and helping one learn to deal with such problems as mine. I think I have seen, over the two months or so I was in attendance there, all of the Physical Therapists there and each seemed very well qualified to treat me. The clinic has a well run front desk that makes sure I did not miss any appointments and which has a friendly sitting room where one can wait to get in for treatment that is very pleasant.

The initial eval (indeed, each tech does his or her own evaluation each time you present to make sure you understand what you were supposed to do since the last treatment and to add to the educational/treatment process) was, in my opinion, very effective for me. That eval talked about what I hoped to achieve, and gave me very specific treatment there to try to effect some improvement at once as well as over time. They very clearly and immediately update (on computers) what they do and what the patient is instructed in each time one is seen and they review each other's notes at each visit. You should expect exercises to take home and they expect you to do them as well as checking at each return visit how you are doing the assigned "home work". 

The secretary at the front desk is a highly competent woman who has sheets of instructions ready for you after each class and who engages each patient each time they come in with kindness. The clinic is laid out in a way that both offers privacy, if needed, and an open environment. They have many tools immediately at hand and are adept at when to use them.

I would recommend this facility (as a very much retired Physician's Assistant) to anyone needing physical therapy. They are even sending their notes to the neurologist seeing me in a month to let that doctor know in what manner I have progressed and what they have observed. My opinion? First rate physical therapy given by very caring professionals well versed in their craft. They also wish the patient a happy birthday;-).

I've had a lot of PT in the last 10 years for back and hip issues. After having a total hip replacement early this year,  I began my rehab with Michele at Spirit Wind. She is smart , compassionate, quickly assesses your needs and follows through with genuine concern and support for your well being and recovery. Her support staff is equally conscientious , helpful. and positive. 

So happy with the amazing services I am receiving. I love how well rounded treatment. They use a philosophy of having their clients see several practitioners so they get the best treatment possible. I am seeing great results in a short period of time. I actually look forward to going to my sessions each week!

After going to a different physical therapist for many months I am so happy to report a marked decrease in my leg and knee pain after just a matter of weeks with Janev Alvarez. She has healing hands, a compassionate demeanor and  gave me home exercises  to do that have made a huge difference. The office itself is calm and peaceful.  I recommend the business and Janev highly.

Leaning Pine Arboretum
Little-known and secluded, this arboretum is perennially quiet. The perfect place to unwind after classes, or relax before a new week.

It's a wonderful garden that's free to visit. Its tucked away and parking is only free on the weekends or with a cal poly permit but it's GORGEOUS.

Never even got a chance to go in, it was closed off. This is located inside the college campus. I'm not entirely sure it's actually open to the public.

Great place for a date, tons of beautiful plant life 

It was a wonderful afternoon walk

Bishop's Foothill Trailhead
Pretty straight up,  strenuous trail.  Great hike from this entrance though. Probably not best trailhead for small kids but it's doable.  Took me about 40 minutes at slow comfortable pace. 

It's a bit awkward getting in and out  (especially out) of what's basically just a slight turnout on the side of a fairly busy road. The hike itself is great but parking here isn't the best.

Great hike,  not too strenuous, but invigorating. 

Love this place. 

Really, this is the only (and by only, I mean best) place to park when hiking Bishop's.

========================================================
Santa Rosa Park
The park has a large grass area, a baseball field, basketball courts, picnic tables. There are public bathrooms right next to the little kids play area. There is a nice structure for playing on. 
This is also a great skatepark. There is a large area specifically for skateboarding and tricks.

I go here often.  They have a great playground for kids.  A bathroom during hours.  Lots of grass for dogs and people to hang out.  A horseshoe pit, roller rink, basketball courts, baseball fields, soccer fields, and an amazing skatepark.

11/10 met the best boy. He was a pretty floof and very well behaved.

Park for all types. Open grassy areas, a playground, skate park, and even an inline hockey rink with a seemless surface.

Well made, glossy smooth, and lights till 10pm. No bikers, cause it‚Äôs time you made your own parks and invited us, deal?

Jack House & Gardens
too focused on the contributions of R. E. Jack rather than life in a Victorian home. Also... not much in the way of furnishings. Because each room was given to a local professional interior decorator to refurbish the house lacks a authentic uniform style. I like the way the docents dress up a la late 1800s!

Beautiful setting near downtown. Well kept. 

Beautiful area. We had our wedding here. Reasonably priced and quick with the deposit refund. Just know that you are responsible for all the set up and breakdown. 

Lovely piece of property

This is a large, relatively new playground in a nice area. The biggest downside is the wood chips.

Great park with lots of space, swings, 2 play structures for different age groups, tennis courts, a basketball court, lots of picnic tables. There are bathrooms and off street parking.

Wonderful place to play pickleball. Friendly people and good playüé∂

French Park is a great place to take the kids to play on the playground, but I take away one start for the volumes of dog poo that I find in the grass.  A little gross, really.

Big Park and great for walking, biking,jogging,. They have a basketball court and a volleyball court to! Great for parties and out door grills and I've seen people have birthday parties inside so you can rent that space as well. Way to many guys though. Oh well it's fun to chill in the sun regardless. 

Nice Basketball court and awesome park for walking around in the trees...and,a sand volleyball court....

Very nice park with a lot of options for everyone. Great perk over other parks are the paths that stretch through the neighborhood along the creek (or drainage path). Would be fine stars if the large playground had more traditional items (slide or swing), also there can be homeless hanging out more than other parks. None of those will keep me away

Great park. Lots of amenities. Good paths. Great grass.

Nice park with nice walking or biking trails.

Costco Pharmacy
Best prices in town. Wait times are typically less than other pharmacies. They process lots of prescriptions; so watch for the occasional error.

I have had a multitude of problems here.  They don't communicate well at all.  Last time I tried to use them it took almost 4 days to get the prescription filled for myself.  Now today after being in the hospital my son's doctor called in medication 3 hours later we go to pick it up and they tell us they don't have enough to fill it.  Why wouldn't you call to tell us that 2 hours ago? It's infuriating. They have horrible customer service and I would NOT recommend using them at all!

We stocked up on USA beef jerky here as you can't buy it in the UK because it's supposedly pumped full of steroids and growth hormones that we don't allow in Europe.  We never exported mad cow disease to the USA but it's legal for you to sell stuff to your citizens that are not legal here. FDA anyone ??

Prices are great. If you don't have insurance, it's still affordable.

Mission Physical Therapy Group
Great place , very professional. Therapy pool was so helpful!

Awesome physical therapists and a well run office!

Absolutely terrible receptionist, she could not care less.

Asked to see a therapist and was told the first appointment was 10 days away, I pointed out I am in a lot of pain and the answer was that there were other places in town (with the tone of 'go away and stop bothering me'). She really had zero interest in helping me. My guess is they get so many referrals from the Cuesta medical across the car park they don't really care to actually try and be nice to patients. 

Called San Luis Sports Therapy and they could see me next day, and super nice.

During my 2 months at Creekside, I barely did any exercises that strengthened my knee.  I enjoyed the water therapy and the woman coordinating that program was excellent.I think her name was TC.  I never felt challenged with my PT, I never felt very much progress. And it was apparent how little progress I had made once I saw my doctor and he instructed me to see another PT to continue my rehab to the full degree I needed to.

I hope that most people do not have this experience. I hope that most people are not left feeling weak and unsteady with unanswered questions. I hope other people do not feel like they are left hanging in the middle of there rehab.

I highly recommend anyone in pain to try Creekside Physical Therapy.  I have had elbow pain (tennis elbow) for months and a cortisone injection did not help.  Then I went to Creekside Physical Therapy and in just a few treatment sessions my elbow pain is so much improved that I am happy beyond words.

Cerro San Luis Obispo
Great 1.5 hour hike to the top and back down. If you start at the Marsh St parking area there is a sign showing some trails. This sign doesn't have the trail going to the top. I think it is just for the area managed by the city. If you want to go to the top from marsh st parking, when you get to the trees three is a trail over a bridge going to the right at a sign with a M on it. Go to the left at that sign. (Going to the right is a short hike to the big letter M.) You'll soon duck under a bar gate. Continue on the single track to the next gate and go through the small gate. Stay on the main road to the top. 

Really nice hike, run or ride! Great for watching the sunset or seeing the city lights at night.

Great hiking spot

This is one of the most popular hikes in  SLO.  The trail  can get a bit steep at times, but once you get to the top you are rewarded with the most amazing 360 degree view of San Luis Obispo. 

Beautiful. Great views and a decent hike.

CVS Pharmacy
Good luck getting anyone on the phone and good luck getting your prescription filled in a timely manner (like 5-6 days). Every single time I call, I'm on hold for at least 10-15 minutes, which is crazy to me. The other day I stood in line for a solid 15 minutes. There are 3 people working and not one single person acknowledged me waiting at the counter.

Their staff are not helpful at all especially when you talk to them over the phone. They hang up on you while you're still talking which is so rude. Refills take a long time to be refilled. I go to other CVS branches and their staff are so nice and accommodating. This branch destroys the image of CVS. 

I used Target Pharmacy for years simply because waiting in CVS lines are such a pain.  As expected, once the switch from Target to CVS was made, slowly I've been waiting longer and longer in line and the pharmacists aren't so readily available.   Mostly the same great helpful employees as before but I'm guessing they are cutting back in scheduling?

I went and asked this young brunette that was juat working on3/23/2017 at 6:50pm i walked up to her to ask for the bathroom and she tells me they dont have one. They do! She only said no because of my tattoos, piercings, probably thought I was homeless just by the way I looked. Not okay!!!! I'm a very well brought up slo resident and have been my whole life. Go to cal poly for a master right now. How dare she be so shallow. Wow!

Always my go to place for questions about fish and aquarium stuff. The owners have a genuine love for the hobby and what they do.

Great local fish store. Helpful friendly staff, and a good selection of both unusual and bread and butter fish.

Great fish store! The staff is super helpful and nice. They get lots of fun and unique fish in, and it's evident that Paul puts lots of thought into the items he stocks. They are always happy to help and will even test your water for issues. If you are looking for something special, just ask and they can often order it for you!

Absolutely love this place! Very knowledgeable and always healthy fish. Won't go anywhere else. Even though its 30 minutes from my house

The best LFS in SLO. Don't go to Petco or Petsmart when you can go to a LFS! Paul was very knowledgeable and helpful and answered all my questions about my tanks and what to stock them with. Will definitely be coming here again!

I appreciate that Kelsey was patient with me and my situation with relevance to winter, door size, screen size - I have a really weirdly constructed door and a rather fat cat named Mia.  Kelsey came up with a great idea for me which I will use for the winter, and another idea for summer, and it is very economical.  This is an excellent company!

At 1st I thought it was a little expensive but once I easily installed it and saw how well it was built and the  I was  more than impressed.    Even fast delivery.  Thank you

I placed an order online and then sent an e-mail to change it before shipping. Thet actually called and helped fix my order so I could get the parts I needed.

There doors are the best you can get and a great value.

Great place to work.  The doors are awesome.  I installed two of them several years ago, one for the cat and one for the dog.  Both still work great.

Aspire Physical Therapy
Absolutely the best.

I went in to see Tyrone McSorley today.  He was extremely qualified and knowledgeable, yet was able to explain everything to me in terms that I could easily understand.  He walked me through each step of the process and gave me clear instructions on what I needed to do to improve the health of my ankle.  

I would strongly recommend Tyrone for anyone who is looking to receive sports therapy or needs someone to look at an injury of any kind.  

Thanks Tyrone, you're the best!

I was refered to this practice by an urgent care doctor when I had overwhelming sciatic pain during my second trimester of pregnancy. I was very comfortable with Ty and he was extremely knowledgable regarding physical changes in a womans body during pregnancy. He even explained how to sit, stand and move - things I didn't think took concious effort, but are actually very important during pregnancy. We were only able to do a few stablizing type excirsizes because my heart rate kept spiking, but I enjoyed the heat therapy and mini back massage very much! 

When my time was up, I still had sciatic pain. I had hoped to be cured, but in reality I was given tools to ensure the sciatic pain didn't get worse and tips to bring my pain back to managable if it every got out of control again. Because the pain was still effecting my daily life (I still couldn't take the stairs or sit for any length of time), I went to a chiropractor as a last ditch effort. Within a couple of weeks of chiropractic care, the sciatic pain was non existant. I strongly believe that it was a combination of chiropractic adjustments and the skills I learned from Ty that keep my pain free today. 

People-wise, this place deserves 5 stars for being knowledgable, friendly and comforting. I give them 4 because I was disappointed that I still had pain, and because their billing system is not my cup of tea. I would have prefered to pay a co-pay at each visit as opposed to one lump payment after treatment. Also, they have had my check for a couple of weeks and still haven't cashed it. I dislike using checks in general, would have prefered an online payment portal and I really wish they were more prompt about cashing it.

San Luis Sports Therapy
Easy to find location with plentiful convenient parking.  I was greeted by Ashley when I arrived and was walked through the paperwork.  It was a nice touch from the over rushed PT facilitates I'm use to in LA.  The facility was clean and air conditioned, with plenty of TV's and things to read.  I highly recommend.

Charlene was great with me I'm optimistic that this maybe just what my body needs only time will tell how it will all work out?

I have used San Luis Sports Therapy a couple of times and I and have referred & will continue to refer anyone I know to them. As an athlete it is very frustrating to be sidelined, they get that and are empathetic. However, they are not afraid to call me out when I try to push too hard in order to force healing. Apparently it "doesn't work that way". Whatever Colleen R. 

In all seriousness, I feel comfortable working with the assistants and any interns they have. I have learned so much about my injury and how it has caused so many other compensatory injuries. They really look for the cause of the problem and tackle it. I went in for my knee and it actually ended up being my gastrocnemius and medial glutes. I am thrilled with my progress and love when Colleen and Keiren decide I need to "Spice it up." Today I have moved from Tabasco to Tapatio, I look forward to Siracha!

Smee's Plumbing
I had another plumber address my plugged toilet issue.  They ran a snake many feet and it appeared to have taken care of the problem until family came to visit and the entire first floor plumbing in 3 bathrooms was backing up.  

Called Smee's Plumbing and Dave, the owner, came one hour later.  After doing some research, he discovered that when the previous plumber ran the snake down the toilet, it knocked off the flip cap from the large exterior tube where all the waste flushes out, and the cap was actually blocking the exit opening.  

I called the original plumber 3 different days over a period of 3 weeks or more and I have never received a return call.  

I am an older woman and know that the previous plumber overcharged me each time he came out.  I can't believe that I was only charged $160 by Dave Smee (charges only his hourly rate) when I was charged over $300 each time the other plumber did any work for me.

Thank you Mr. Smee for coming out so promptly and taking care of my problem.  It's encouraging to find a business that provides such excellent service and also who is very honest and reasonable!  You will hear from me again the next time I need a plumber.

Called today, David arrived in 3o minutes. A storm drain was slow and would overflow in the house on a rainy day. It rained today!! Dave was kind,  very thorough and professional. Another nice man came to help David and was just as professional!! 

I would recommend this company !! 

Price was fair.

Needed help urgently. Called two other plumbers who still haven't returned my call (5 days ago). Terry fixed the problem and cleared the line and trap to prevent future issues. SO GRATEFUL!

Terry from Smee's was professional and extremely knowledgeable! Wouldn't hesitate to call again in the future and recommend 100%. 

Called about a clogged shower drain at 3:00pm. Terry showed up in 15 minutes. Fixed it in about 20 minutes. Friendly to boot. Couldn't ask for anything better!

I have been using Finn Plumbing for a few years now, he was referred to me by Brooks Woodcraft, and I have been so happy with his service! Plumbing problems are such trouble, and such an inconvenience. When I call he gets out fast to fix my problem. In a hair salon we have Lots of Hair! and boy does it cause a problem with the drains, now Noel comes out 2 times a year as preventative maintenance, and we have had no more problems-I would highly recommend him, very professional and friendly service!

San Luis Obispo Police Department
They neglected my assault/stalking case. They never bothered to read my written testimony (I have a medical condition due to the assault which has left me with horrible memory/concentration problems), they never attempted to contact my witnesses (they had a direct interaction with the suspect and elements of the assault were discussed between them), and they disregarded my other pieces of evidence (including my medical record). They let the case sit for about three months, and whoever was supposed to work my case (I didn't even know who was working my case at the time) was difficult to communicate with. On top of that, they made a lot of "police opinion" about the situation, my relation to the suspect, and my conditions during and after the assault. These assumptions were the very thing that stalled and ultimately ruined my case. They told me that they only have 5 detectives working "hundreds of cases" as an excuse. However, this does not excuse negligence. They need to either hire more detectives or hire detectives with a higher work ethic. Very disappointed with this department.

Update: I filed a citizen's complaint and the department is now taking the case much more seriously. I don't want to think about how many people might have been in my situation and never received the attention they needed. I appreciate the department's recent efforts and am more confident in my case.

Thanks for stepping up patrols on areas where bicyclists have been hit.  You can make a difference at the corner of Foothill and Casa.  I get swiped there about once a week.

Handled my concerns with highly dignified follow-up as losing my twin and younger brother Dubrovich of tragic deaths in San  Francisco. God bless all of you and officers!!

Thai Palace
Delicious Thai food with pretty generous portions. The chicken is very tangy and flavorful. What I appreciate was that they were one of a very limited number of restaurants open on a holiday. It was nice to get a good quality meal at a time I might have settled for McDonalds.

This place is excellent. It's very rare that I use that word to describe restaurants but this is one of, if not, the best Thai restaurant I've been to. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, the service is good and the food is fantastic! I highly recommend stopping by this place for dinner

All three of our party noted it was some of the best Thai food they've had -- Yellow curry, Pad Thai (tofu), and Cashew Nut (tofu). Server was pleasant, too.

This place had good food and attentive service. Everyone was pleasant and respectful. I will be back.

The service was fast and our server was very pleasant. The food was great. I had the Shitaki and Green with Jasmine rice. The coconut soup was amazing, loaded with veggies and just enough heat to make it great. I'd come back just for the soup it was so good.

United States Postal Service
no tall vehicle parking in the parking garage; metered street parking always full except maybe weekend or holiday when closed

It's a post office, when have you not had a line? The parking structure spots dedicated to the PO makes visits quick and easy.

This is a nice post office location because it's right downtown. It has 3 parking spots in front that are green so you don't have to pay for them. People are pretty good about only Park in those spots when they're going to the post office. If you're desperate there's a parking lot right behind the post office you can use. The one thing you have to be careful about is the last pickup in the box across the street is at 3:30.

I ship several 35-65 lb packages daily from here and unlike every other post office I have been to, they have never lost any of my packages! They are a bit understaffed so avoid the lines by printing out your shipping labels beforehand and setting them on the counter. Overall, an A+

My mail has been in "acceptance" for over 2 months in San Luis Obispo. USPS claims it was sent, but it never reached its destination, and it isn't able to be recovered. I really hope I get this mail some day.

SLO Classical Academy High School
Linger, I'm a parent that's been with the school nearly from the beginning. your assessment of the administration not leading by example is laughable. we all understand that the school isn't for everyone, perhaps you included. you are wrong to write such nonsense in a public forum. your comments are inaccurate, indefensible, misinformed, and outlandish.

following up, Linger...whoops! did you not notice the lesbian couples whose kids attend our school? the non-believers? the folks who go to church elsewhere? lots of those folks are coming back, too. new families are joining us. the application process is incomplete, but it looks certain that attendance will be up from last year. 

I didn't bother stating my own opinion about the school since it was implied by my family's continued commitment to the school that we love it. we love that those lesbians and non-believers and other church attenders love it too. and they do. they are all our friends, and I love it that they are our friends. I'm honored that they call me their friend.

I am truly sad the school didn't work for you. indeed I am. but in seeing your willingness to defame the school, I also am happy to declare to the world on this review that you really have little idea of which you speak.

the floor is yours. I'll give you the last word & let others decide if they should or should not look into our school. I'm biased toward our school and my ability to persuade...I believe I am in the lead on this one.

San Luis Obispo Classical Academy is where I wish I had gone to school. With such a loving staff and driven curriculum, SLOCA is a community that forges character, fosters wisdom, and nurtures a lifelong passion for learning.

A very unique school- great school, great books, great kids, great teachers!  This school combines school and homeschool.  The kids go to school two days a week and I get to homeschool them the other 3 days! The class sizes are small, only 12 kids per class.  My children love it and are thriving.  We are lucky to have such an option on the Central Coast!

Terrible administration with no one leading by example. They consistently make hasty choices without parent and teacher feedback. What began as a beautiful idea is now crumbling. School has gotten too much of an EGO and has forgotten their way. Instead of driving children to love learning, they are cramming over-the-top, highly cerebral curriculum down their throats. They have also done away with their anti-bully model and allow terrible things to happen to other children without recourse. Great teachers do happen to be here if you're lucky enough to get one that has stayed on for more than 2 years. The turn around is ridiculous. My child had two new teachers come in mid-year two years in a row! Parents are exhausted with all that is being asked of them and now they decide to raise tuition? Crazy!
@Bischbubba: Apparently, the review tool of this public forum whizzed by your comprehension. From my understanding it is completely fair and valuable for me to give my honest feedback of this school. In fact, as a classical educating parent at SLOCA, you should already know the context from where the word "forum" is derived from. If not, let me jog your mind...Ancient Greece and Rome...the 6th. century BCE...Aristotle, Socrates, Plato? It's interesting to me that you would find my opinion wrong or invaluable. I can only thank you for sharing your opinion and be glad that this school worked out for you. I thank you also for reinforcing with your rhetoric exactly the kind of egocentric baloney that goes in tandem with SLOCA. It seems as though this school is beginning to unravel. However, I'm sure it can survive as a perfect school for cookie-cutter, same church going, narrow thinking individuals. Heaven forbid you have an opinion or thought of your own to share!

Family owned and operated since the 60's, the owner knows the area and how to find the perfect home for his clients. He is scrupulously honest, and quietly gives back to the community he grew up & raised his family in.

I had to call the office twice to make sure that the missing unit # be added on the address label on my package. On both days the representatives were very cordial, helpful, and professional! Big thanks!

My mail usually gets delivered but only after waiting for more than a week at this office. Recently a customer insisted on paying cash through mail and unfortunately the letter was torn apart with just 1 corner of a $50 remaining. I also order many items and I end up just getting a couple shipping label inside of the typical USPS envelope saying my package was damaged and contents are missing. A Plano case that I shipped looked like it had been hit by a plane prop; heavy duty polymer had been shredded and contents were all gone. I sure would like to know how this excessive damage is occuring and where all my missing items are.

Employees are always polite & helpfulüëç

Disgusting how much time of my time this place has wasted. Incredibly incompetent.

Got my passport done here and it came in record time. Have picked up packages that were not delivered. They explained to me why. In my case the carrier could not manage two heavy packages to the second floor. Left a hand written note explaining why.

Team Sweasey
Hal Sweasey and his team are excellent. I just purchased a house through them, and they made it extremely easy. I am from out of town, and I am not that familiar with the ins and outs of real estate transactions. They went out of their way to meet my schedule, answer general questions, answer particular questions about the property, and get everything done promptly. Hal has given me great advice (and no pressure to follow it). Melody is amazing at getting things done almost immediately. The entire team has been more helpful than I could have imagined. I would definitely recommend them to anyone selling or buying real estate in the area.  They are incredibly good (professional, responsive, efficient, and great at resolving problems).

I couldn't be more happy with my transaction.  Lindsey Harn with Team Sweasey is extremely talented.  She helped us quickly find a new home, navigate a complex double escrow situation, and close escrow early.  During our home search, she asked all the right questions in order to narrow down the list of potential homes to the ones we would really like.  She had the right contacts to call up for specific issues such as foundation settling, in order for us to have peace of mind.  She had great judgment in making recommendations about what we should do to handle a property boundary problem as well.  Many thanks to Lindsey and Hal, as well as the other professionals at Team Sweasey who were involved!

Lindsey was great.  Flexible to meet my schedule, receptive to my needs.
Overall transaction went smooth.

Hal Sweasey has been our agent of choice for the past 25 years through various transactions, the latest being a difficult family trust sale for my wife. Hal's straight-talking communication and negotiation skills, as well as his attention to detail, are the reasons we are long-time clients of Hal (Remax Del Oro). My wife and I would highly recommend Hal Sweasey and his excellent team to anybody looking for an outstanding result.

 Rusty and Sharon Jones

Hal and his team were awesome! They made selling our house simple and painless. They know their business and do it well!

Steve Hopkins was highly recommended o me when I was looking for a realtor.  He lived up to his reputation as The Very Best in every way.
As an 80-someting woman alone, I needed someone who could guide me through the process of selling my home and make sure everything was done correctly and on schedule.  Steve took a personal interest in helping to get the house and yard in shape to show to the best advantage and either recruited someone from his own staff  or put me in touch with outside agencies or individuals to provide other services as needed.  At his recommendation I listed the house at a higher price than I expected, but it actually sold in only four days - and for more than the listing price.  Everything moved along so quickly that it was less than five weeks before escrow was closed.  I will recommend Steve Hopkins.to anyone looking for a realtor in the future.  He is truly amazing!

Finding and buying a home, along with the escrow process can be a nightmare, but Steve guided us expertly through the process.  He was knowledgeable, proactive, and thorough.  He also made himself available to us 24/7, always making us feel as if we were his only priority!  He is the best!

We have had the honor of working with Steve Hopkins on buying a house and recently selling our 2nd house.  What a huge asset he is to have on your side when it comes to selling or buying.  He has tremendous experience, one of the best reputations in the county, and such a pleasure to work with.  He is so knowledgeable about our local market, the ups and downs, you feel very confident when it's the right time for you to buy or sell.  My husband and I both highly recommend Steve.  We look at it this way, if we need someone to guide us, we want Steve.  We would not want the other side to have him first...................so if you are looking to buy or sell contact Steve, he is the best asset for your team!

In my selling and buying transaction of two homes, Steve Hopkins has been the most caring, thorough and thoughtful person.  Patiently explaining all the transactions  to me and being extremely efficient in  the follow up at all levels.  I couldn't have had a better real estate agent.

We had a great experience working with Steve and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend his services or work with him again. We were relocating from San Francisco and Steve previewed every house to ensure we only saw good houses on our visits down here. He went above and beyond during the escrow process to make sure every aspect of the house and property was inspected by professionals so we were totally comfortable with the purchase. He really cares that his clients find the perfect home and he helped us find ours!

Cielo - Downtown Living in San Luis Obispo
I like the bar but had the worst experience ever with the manager or owner, Chris. I was at the bar Tuesday night. Everyone in the bar was having a great time. Some drunk guy yelled out that this is his bar, he was being very rude to the customers and the employees. I asked one of the bartenders and they said it was the manager Chris, and that he wasn't working. He was just their for some reason.  "Chris" was intoxicated and continued to yell out that this is his bar, "THIS IS MY BAR" over and over again, prob 10 to 20 times, Everyone was just ignoring him but then at about 11:30 he started turning on the lights in the bar and trying to start fights and kick people out. (I have no idea why, tons of people were buying drinks, dancing and having a great time) The entire staff agreed that the lights should stay off and the bar stay open for business. This went on for about an hour till 12:30 when finally everyone had enough of this guy and just started leaving. meanwhile this guys is literly getting in peoples faces trying to start fights. Multipule members the staff asked asked him to leave several times but he wouldn't. nothing the employees could do.   If he is the owner I would never work for him or spend another dollar their, next time im down town if i go try this place again im gonna leave if i see this guy. If you do go to Ciello, stay away from a guy named "Chris", severe mental issues. Not just your average drunk. employee or owner of Cielo, San Luis Obispo CA.

It's a Subway so not too much to say. It's popular with Travelers that don't want to go to the McDonald's around the corner.

Usually pretty quick service and a clean facility. Menu is just like any other subway. 

The service is always top notch. My favorite Subway location in SLO.

Like any other Subway. Quick, fast, tasty. Friendly service.

Good  price for my money

Mathews Trailer Lodge
I did not stay here so my rating is based on my interaction with the manager as they had no spots open. We were looking for a one month spot. This park does not do over night sites. The park is small, quaint and cute. You have to go in and talk to the manager directly, he had paper applications for you to fill out and he will then interview you. You need to apply  in advance, it is hit or miss with getting openings. We are applying for next winter. I liked the manager, he is very helpful. The parking is very very tight so I would advise for those who are super ninja trailer parkers only.

Perfect

Buen servicio. Y. Comodidad

Sushi Kokku
We live in the neighborhood and this is one of our favorite spots for lunch or dinner.  Not fancy but just good clean well made Japanese food. Noodle bowls, rolls, tempura, udon, it's all good.

Edit:
We ate there again over the weekend, actually take-out sushi, and it was excellent, as always.  It is a minor thing on the menu but the seaweed salad is terrific, simple and tasty.

My husband actually ate here and got full, which never happens because he's so stupid picky. Awesome place to get food.

I am blown away by the reviews on here.  After eating this food I came back to the page to check the reviews thinking, "I should have read the reviews first."  Blow away by the GREAT reviews because I found the food seriously lacking in flavor.  Japanese food is known to have great and powerful flavors, this just didn't.  Very, VERY bland and disappointing.  Portions were pretty good and price was just right.  However, even with that, I will never go back.  It was that bad.  üòù

The food was fine but the restaurant is having a major identity crisis. One wall is blue, another green, red, etc. Classical music was being played over the speakers. Random paintings on the walls. Oh, and there's a large chandelier hanging in the middle of the place.

Great small sushi place that has reasonable food with reasonable prices! Loved the sushi bowl for $9.95 add some siracha with a miso soup. And its amazing.

Awesome landlords.. pro.pt on any maintenance needed done, willing to work with you, family owned and ran, fellow Christian Brothers and sisters they even have a stack of free Bible's at the reception desk they give free of charge what a way to plant a seed of faith (a mustard seed of faith can move mountains)...

Mid-State Properties L.L.C. through a aka James Wesley Smith, and close ties to law enforcement, thanks to Jere Sullivan, unlawfully evicted the real and only owner of her home of 16 years. She is disabled, on fixed income,  and to us she is a true hero. She has mantained and has proof she purchased her home and property with cash! Not only that but she donated tens of thousands of dollars to programs that only benefited the community of Cambria. Including the local chapter of Habitat for Humanity in SLO. To the tune of 40 thousand dollars. Now she is displaced, living from day to day and lives in her car. This Realty company used a forged deed and stronged armed her out of her home. The Reason? They thought they could flip it without her knowledge! They should try this in hell if the market permits...or Tierra del Fuego... would like to see them then.

This company is bad they allow tweekers and verbally abusive tenets into their properties and then kick out the people that are being abused for reasons they had no proof of that it was true and correct. Only proof that they had was from the tweekers and verbally abusive tenets, did not look into the verbal harassment just got rid of the nice, down to earth, mind their own business kind of people.

Mike's Shoes
Mike, the owner, is the kindest man who will work endlessly to find you what you need. What an awesome place to shop at, with prices that beat pretty much anywhere online. Their selection is great, and they are the definition of a well run family owned business.

I went to a Chiropractor that showed me my shoes were part of my cause of hip and back pain. He recommended Mike's Shoes to get a pair of walking shoes for my job. The service was above and beyond any shoe place I have ever been to in my 57yrs of life. The knowledge and recommendation for footwear was wonderful. I replaced all my shoes in my house with new shoes that work for my body. NO MORE PAIN in my hips or back like before came down to proper shoes, with the help of the staff at Mike's shoes in SLO

Best shoe store ever! The quality of all the shoes is excellent, the value is excellent, and the service is even beyond excellent. My daughter and I were there for two hours, and throughout all the salespeople were not only helpful and courteous and knowledgeable, but truly delightful, supportive and kind. 

I also very much appreciate that Mike's Shoes carries Israeli made shoes - thank you! That really matters to me as a Jew, especially in these times!  

I will be back every time I  have shoe needs because I have never shopped in a better store!

Excellent service. Sales girl was exceptionally helpful. Great quality shoes. Would definitely recommend. 

A family business that has a personal interest in helping the folks in Slo get quality shoes. Very good sale rack

Traci Ferguson - Realtor
Traci assisted my wife and I in the purchase of our coastal home last year.  She gained a quick understanding of our interests and focused on properties that met our criteria..  Since our primary home is out of the area, Traci was sensitive to making good use of our time.  We found the home we purchased in just one day after spending several months looking on our own.  

Traci kept us informed and did an excellent job of managing the purchase process.  We closed on time with favorable terms.  

We recommended Traci for our close friends who also purchased a coastal home and were equally satisfied.

I strongly recommend Traci as a competent, professional and personable Realtor.


My husband and I wouldn't have our dream home had it not been for Traci.  We bought our home in Arroyo Grande in March of 2013.  She demonstrated an excellent understanding of the real estate market on the central coast.  She really listened to us and even managed to hear the things we weren‚Äôt saying about the homes we didn‚Äôt like.  She had an intelligent and comprehensive answer to all of our questions.  We feel Traci went out of her way to help us buy a house, including previewing homes for us (we moved from the SF Bay Area), strategizing on the phone late at night, and responding to our many, many emails promptly.  She took us step by step through the escrow process and closing.  She is professional, friendly, honest, and a great negotiator.  We definitely recommend her if you‚Äôre considering selling or buying a home on the central coast.

The bottom line is that Traci just helped me sell my home. Honestly, ‚Äúhelped‚Äù is an understatement. This was a unique sale that required her to mediate between buyer and seller, as well as working with the escrow, inspection and financing representatives. Traci was always available, and handled all challenges with the utmost professionalism. I would highly recommend her for all your real estate needs.

G-Brothers Smokehouse
Great tasting barbecue.  We ordered the tri tip and ribs and was not disappointed. Very flavorful and tender. Homemade barbecue sauces were good. Homemade ranch was excellent. Friendly staff. A little bit of a wait, but worth it.

Food is amazing. Decor and atmosphere doesn't match. It could use some upgrades. Years ago I had tons of fun here and it's exactly the same. 

The food is really good and the people that work there are very friendly

OM-G Brothers!!!  This place is amazing!!  I had the pork burrito and everything about it was perfect!  My husband had the brisket and eggs and the brisket was tender and delicious.  We will definitely be back when we pass through town!!  Very easy access off the highway too.

Portions have gotten smaller than they used to be, other then that awesome food!

Shalimar Restaurant Indian Food
One of the best restaurants in the vicinity. Whenever we go to SF while coming back we definitely have our lunch or dinner here. They have good choices of vegetarian and chicken items and how spicy you want is customizable.food orders are quick and waiters do an awesome job. . Definitely a must eat restaurant.

Love their food. The  Nan bread is really good. They offer vegetarian and non vegetarian choices and Chai tea is included with lunch.

This place is great! We went with a big group for my daughter's birthday and everyone had good things to say about their meals. Prices are very reasonable too. Will definitely be back.

Good service, good food.  There aren't any warnings as to what is spicey or not,  so be careful if you can't stand the heat...but all the food is awesome.   My kids kept going back for the spinach curry.

I loved the food, The service, and the general look of the dining area. The food has its wait times, but that is to make sure that the food is in top shape. i loved every aspect about it and would dine here every week.

Firestone Grill
Portions are enormous!  Pig sandwich was great - and huge, side order of fries is enough for 4 people :)  The beans are very tasty but they were barely warm.  No one in our party liked the coleslaw and couldn't figure out what was in it that gave it the funky taste.  Service was good the restaurant was clean.

They make great burgers and tri-tip sandwiches. It can get very busy at peak times, but they do have a lot of outside seating as well as their indoor tables. You order and pay and are given a number on your receipt. Your number is called and you pick up your food. They also have a bar and areas where they do table service instead of ordering first before sitting down. I have found the tables to be dirty more often than not.

The steak sandwich is amazing. The steak Cobb salad is also great. They also have burgers and beers. Atmosphere is chill but can be a bit loud. Especially during important sporting events.

Great food. Large burgers, sandwiches, salads. Everything is freshly grilled with fast service so you can eat right away. Firestone is very popular, and it gets pretty crowded, so arrive early if you want to dine inside. Otherwise, their patio is good for very large groups.

One of the local favorites of San Luis Obispo. Great cheeseburgers made over a wood burner and they are really known for having some awesome fries (they come a little on the salty side, but that's how I like them). Service is always fast, polite and anything that ever was wrong was immediately made right. Expect to be in a crowded restaurant and good luck trying to get a seat during farmers market. But otherwise ample indoor and outdoor seating with a large bar area.

Century 21 Tim Riley Real Estate
We used Tim Riley as our agent when we bought a home in 2003 and again when we sold the home in 2017.  He is very professional and has great client service.  We got an excellent offer  and closed escrow in record time.  we could not be happier with the service and results we received from Tim.  We would definitely use him again and again.

This is the second property we've purchased using Tim. He is experienced, knowledgeable, professional, and kind. I always felt confident through each step of the buying process. Responsive and patient - even when I asked A LOT of questions, Tim goes above and beyond. I'd recommend him to anyone without reservation!

Tim has been the #1 sales rep with Century 21 for several years for a reason! He was extremely thoughtful and helpful in all of our home viewings. Not sure why other reviewer stated what she did, but this was not how we saw Tim in action as he showed us numerous homes before finding us the home we live in (in the City of S.L.O.). We have referred him to our sons, who both purchased local homes through him, and several friends. All absolutely loved dealing with him. He is truly is one of the most honest, thoughtful, and knowledgeable real estate persons I've ever dealt with. I highly recommend Tim Riley to you!

Tim Riley is THE BEST! He helped my wife and I purchase our first home together, and we've recommended him to our friends and family who have also become fans of Tim. He's professional, reliable, responsive, and provides great guidance. Tim is definitely our go-to guy!

Repeat client of Tim‚Äôs, selling and purchasing. Would highly recommend him and his staff. Professional, thoughtful and first class.

Quaglino Roofing
Great guys to deliver product to.  Just park on the Fiero and check in. They will move trucks to allow you to do a U-turn in a 48ft trailer. 

Quaglino's employees not only took 4 hours longer than expected to complete a simple job due to the amount of mid-work breaks they took, but they left our house filthy, with roof-work droppings covering and damaging our furniture inside the home. Low quality work, due to a sincere lack of care. Call a real roofer even if you have to source them from one of the surrounding towns.

Quaglino's is always fast to respond and they put in the extra effort when it comes to maintenance.

Quaglino Properties and Roofers is a very poorly managed operation with a very low reputation among people who actually do business with this organization.  Our school had nothing but problems as a result of Matt Quaglino and his extremely greedy and manipulative ways of handling our lease and many other issues tied to our commercial properties.  We join many others who feel a very strong need to voice our opinions about the way this company, and particularly this low-life -- has been allowed to continue to run his business in San Luis Obispo.  We can only hope that this warning gets out to others that might fall prey to this horrible operation.  Beware.  Do not do business with Quaglino Properties or Roofers.  They are the worst.

I  tried for a few week trying to get in touch with a roofer on a time sensitive job.  There are a half dozen or so roofers certified to do the roofing project I needed and I called well over a dozen times over a two week time period.  About one third of the times I actually talked to a receptionist and would be promised a call back by a roofer / and or estimator. Everytime I got ahold of a live person (as many times I had to leave voicemails or just hang up and call back), I was told that a roofer would call me later that day or the following day.  When I would wait until the following day and the times I talked to a receptionist  I received that same "someone will be in touch with you by tomorrow".  Twice I was given a four hour time window to meet with an estimator (after the many attempts) and no one ever showed up. One of the most unprofessional construction / roofers I've ever had to deal with as they took a considerable amount of my time be not being upfront saying their either too busy or uncoordinated enough to do my job (which was a $10,000++ Job). Being the summer season, I lost out on a chance w/two different roofers to get the job done as they became too busy.  I kept trying to make it work with Quaglino's as they quoted me about a 10% cheaper price, but in retrospect I think they were just stringing me along with a cheaper quote to see if they lost another job and then could fit me in ( and possibly charge me more add ons later).  I would honestly not bother wasting my time with them.  Now I'm searching for a roofer and many are too busy as I should have realized that if something seems too good, it probably is. Just my advice, as I grew up in the area and want fellow homeowner's to know my experience.  I have no recommendations locally as I'm now stuck trying to find a roofer.

Eureka! San Luis Obispo
Good Food. Had the Fresno Fig Burger and it was Delicious!! The Fig Marmalade was fantastic. Very clean and well organized. Good beer selection. And very friendly staff. Visiting from out of state.... I will.be back.

Great location and vibe to go along with the food and alcohol selection. Awesome for whiskey and beer, and the bartenders are good at their drinks. Maybe the food isn't the best bang for your buck, but I'll always say yes to going. The bison and bone marrow burgers are a must

Taking the American kitchen to the next level. Fig preserves bacon burger "out of this world", chicken nachos could use more authentic flavors,  and kids menu interesting.  Service was quick and friendly.  Relaxed atmosphere with a variety of old rock playing in the background.

SO. GOOD. Burgers are absolutely fantastic. The fries are awesome as well. I'd heavily recommend the Fig and Goat Cheese burger. Tastes so good (even if you don't like goat cheese all that much)

Best restaurant experience! Not only were the staff exceptionally nice and genuine the food was extremely flavorful and exceeded all my expectations. We met the manger briefly and he bought us a dessert to end the night. If you don‚Äôt like good food, this is not the place for you.

Perfect place for authentic Thai food and hospitality.  The front of the house staff as well as the kitchen offer customers with welcoming smiles and a very familial ambiance.  Thai Boat has definitely made a customer for life.

Great food. Great staff. Everyone was friendly. Seating is close together but works. Makes it feel more family oriented. 
The menu is extensive. Alot of different foods to try. We had the fried wontons, chicken green curry and the Pa Nang chicken curry. Both excellent! Will definitely be back.

they are so nice.  they are closed on weekends.  they also randomly are closed.  I love the garlic noodles.

One the best places I have eaten in SLO hands down! The best customer service and the food is amazing. Gets busy at lunch time so plan ahead if you are planning to eat there.

My partner and I always love coming to the Thai boat for three reasons, we always have a place to sit and eat, the food is phenomenal and you are helped by some of the friendliest people on the Central Coast.

The ppl working (especially the guy) working that night was incredible...mom and I had low blood sugars, were exhausted, and he just understood the urgency I had to get mom and I feed. He made our sandwiches perfectly and was patient with my fuzzy brain (due to low sugar). Only subway I have been to bc this was my 1st trip to Santa Barbara, SLO and Santa Maria. I appreciate his kindness and patience the most! I always appreciate Subways that carry the veggie patty/veggie max. 

Thanks to this employee who helped us that night!

I like Subway.  Great value.  I just say "LOTS of everything".  I wind up with a sandwich that is a huge salad with some deli slices.  Love it.

Always courteous.  They are patient, even if you're a little slow making up your mind about what you want.  They are helpful with coupons.  Food is always fresh. I like seeing the calorie count on the menu board.

Bad service bad everything all the way around horrible people drug addicts

The best Subway in town. Better than Jersey Mike's even!

it's good

Great school!

My three children attend/attended this school and they love it! They are getting an excellent education with excellent college counseling advice. They have made amazing friends, enjoy participating in the great sports programs and fun social events, and best of all, their sense of personal responsibility and organization have flourished! GO ROYALS!

I was forced to spend my freshman year here after going to public school my whole life. By far the worst year of my life. It was like sitting at that high school for a year and having needles poked in to my eyes. Every student there absolutely hated it.

Woodstock's Pizza SLO
Been going here since I was a kid. I feel the quality has diminished overtime however it's still one of the closest pizza places to us and it's convenient when down town! Why can't the dough support the cheese and toppings, even when on thick or well done crust? If you try to grab a slice you end up leaving your cheese and toppings behind laying in the box. Salads are good! Chicken wings good! Ranch can get super salty

Nice relaxed pizza place.  I had pizza and an antipasto salad and they were both good.  The place has the typical pizza place atmosphere which is what I was looking for.  The staff was nice and the place was very clean.  Definitely would go back.

Food is pretty good.  If you want a delivery, you have to buy at least $50 worth of food.  The alternative was to go into the restaurant which I did the time before and waited in line for 30 min, even though I called in my order.  So if you are patient, the pizza is good and you will like it.  If you are in a hurry or want a small delivery, think about somewhere else.

Woodstock's was a favorite of mine when I lived in SLO, and it's still great all these years later.  Bonus points for having hands-down the best gluten-free crust I've ever had to date.  Friendly staff, flavorful toppings, and all kinds of entertainment to watch.

Great pizza and fast service. The place is very clean all the time; a lot of employees keep coming around and picking up the stuff from the tables.

This place is fantastic! Very friendly service and amazing food! The manager waited on us and the entire staff couldn't have been more professional and friendly. I would have to say that this place ranks in the top 5 best dining experiences ever! Anything on the menu is incredible, the entire staff  were speaking fluently in Italian, it doesn't get much closer to Northern Italy without being there!

This place is awesome. Everything we had was cooked perfectly and the dessert was amazing. There was a special for 3 course meal that was totally awesome. If you like Italian food you will love this place.

Feels like home with food even better than Nonna's, friendly service, great wine list and always interesting and delicious specials.

This is the best Italian restaurant in San Luis Obispo. The food is exceptional albeit a bit pricey. They have a wonderful patio out back and you want to make sure you sit in it. If you want a festive romantic night out this is the place to go. Lunches are a little more affordable with similar food so that's an option if budget is more of a concern for you.

Such great food and romantic patio. Very reasonable lunch prices around $14 per plate! Friendly service and love the Piedmont will e list and imported cheeses for full Italy experience.

Foothill Preschool-Infant Care
All of our teachers work very hard to insure the fun and safety of our children while making sure they have a memorable 
learning experience.

Our 6 year old went to Foothill until he was just under 5 years old. It was great the teachers where so kind and with Cal Poly ECE students working they developed great ways to teach the kids every week. He loved it there.

We now have a 1 year old going as well. The teachers are great and he loves going. I would highly recommend this school to anyone. It is hard to get into so keep that in mind.

Our daughter went her a few years ago and we loved it so after we adopted our 2nd child we called and secured our son a spot.  Wow how times have changed.  Ella seems like she is checked out and just doesn't care anymore and the teachers complain about doing their jobs and act like they are doing you a major favor by doing even their basic job.   Every day last week I was called to pick my child up early, each day for a different stupid excuse.  Why am I paying them if they just send him home for being a 2 year old boy.  Answer is that as of today we aren't, we found someone who actually wants to do the job we are paying them for.

I would not recommend this school. I was a teacher in the infant room and was appalled at how the babies were not given the attention they deserved. The facility was dirty and and toys on  the playground were not safe. Unfortunately, the director was not open to my suggestions and would not hire more staff so that teachers could provide quality care to the children.


As a parent I feel it's my responsibility to inform other parents of our experience at this daycare/preschool.  Our little 2 year old was injured on his second day of daycare at this school.  We do not know how it happened because the supervisors on staff all claimed to had not seen him fall & we were never notified when his head began to swell (due to the injury).  I picked him up promptly after my workday ended and I found him with a swollen head (horrifyingly-so, in my opinion as his mother).  I called it to the attention of his teacher and asked her what happened.  It seemed like it was the first time she was noticing that he looked odd.  After asking a bunch of questions about if he fell, or if he was bit by a spider (which she did confirm they had a problem with), or what he ate, I rushed down the street to the ER at Sierra Vista.

After waiting quite a while in the ER to get seen we finally had a CT scan done and it turned out he had a skull fracture and a subdural hematoma.  After all this, I have to say we were very lucky that he was not fatally or permanently injured.  The police & CPS were both notified and are conducting their investigation of the childcare facility.  

While we as parents recognize and accept that accidents happen (especially with toddlers), it is our responsibility to also inform other parents so they can provide the best care for their children.  I really believe the school didn't intentionally hurt our baby, but he was also unsupervised and even neglected (to the degree that they didn't see his head swelling) for some time.

Please help spread the word to anyone who is going to or thinking about going to this preschool.

Thanks!

P.S. My son's accident took place on Sept. 2nd, 2010

Were you actually charged the $150 without the shoes being shipped. If you were charged you should be able to get your order number from the receipt and then contact the company with the order number. It would be easier to track down the order that way. I would be curious to know if you ever got your shoes.

Super nice girl helped me. It is very hard to see and find. Trees cover the sign and its a small place.

The only place I can find shoes in my size.   I just wish they had a bigger woman's section (sizes 10 and up) with prettier choices. 

Bonitos zapatos yea.

Chumash Village
The first trailer park I've been to, that has two pools! Plus those old geezers always leave their keys in their cars.

This place would shut down Peyton Place and Upstairs Downstairs would fail in the shadow of Double wide., Single wide! 

Good buffet

Senior living only

I love Chumash Village. My mother lives here, and I must say, I really enjoy visiting her here. We always go swimming in either of the pools, and sometimes go to the clubhouse to play Bingo. The people are friendly, and the park just has a great atmosphere about it. Even though I don't live here, I highly recommend it, and so does my mother!

========================================================
Willow Creek Country Estates
Great mobile home park but has one serious deffect. Park owner allows for conspicous tree-trimming and landscaping companies to operate out of it's R.V. storage area lot. Makes for very noisy rumbling of huge trucks through park daily, as early as 6:00 a.m. and up to 9 p.m. City and county officials are duped by being told lot is only used for storing trucks. Park/property managers are helpless to curtail illegal activity, not wanting to creat waves and lose their cozy positions. Only park in san luis to have this going on. Please think twice before moving here. Grass area is often used to run dogs and allow them to defecate all over the place without picking up after them. Drunks usually walk throughout lane with open containers. Dumpsters are filled up with refuse brought in from tree trimming truck operators from outside of park. Drugs are of common use. Lackadaisical park manager when it comes to park maintenance or residents needs. Loud parties at clubhouse going on late into the night without constraint past cut-off times. Noisy leaf-blowers used frequently to blow mud and dirt left over from huge tree trimming trucks operating in a clandestine manner from within park. Along with a host of other law/rule breaking actions taking place daily, this is not the most desireable place to be in s.l.o.

Great place to live and share with others

Great weather and hid away nicely

Old park but great residents and a beautiful part of town

FLIP FLOP SHOPS
Good selection of flip flops in leather, pleather, plastic, etc. They offer dress sandals, water friendly sandals, and even vegan friendly sandals. They have quite a few popular brands as well. I found them to be expensive, but they did have a nice selection. The staff was friendly and helpful.

Large selection of popular flip flops, friendly and helpful staff.

High end quality sandals

Real friendly staff, well organized, fun atmosphere. The lack of Ipanema sandals is a bit disappointing, but forgiveable since they carry other brands.

Great selection of men's and women's sandals in all the hot brands. 

========================================================
Charles Shoes
Been going to Charles Shoes since I was a kid with my mother.  She was a bartender and waitress so was on her feet for hours at a time and needed good comfortable shoes to work in. The staff was friendly and and knew exactly what she needed. Still today 30 plus years later I go in with my girlfriend and she got the same great service that they used to give my Mom.

Great service, lovely people, excellent size ranges.

Great selection of shoes and very knowledgeable and attentive staff.

Nice selection of shoes and helpful staff

I always have the most fun and the best customer experience shopping for footwear at Charles'. Wonderful and knowledgable staff. I have been shopping here for at least 15 years. They are best shoe store in SLO County!

San Luis Obispo High School
Politically biased (Left leaning) school, most of the teachers are bad some are good but not enough of them are. A lot of teachers are really old and irratable so they tend to pin things on students they dislike. There's a reason the school has a rating of 2.9. In short could be better: 3/5

mrs.sawyer and ms.hawley and weinshenk dog are the only good parts of slohs

Most teacher's are just cruel and don't know how to teach.

as a virgin i can relate to most of the teachers

the teacher picks which kids she hates and then tries to pin blame on them

GH Sports
Locally owned manufacturer of swimming, running, biking, triathlon clothing and gear. The retail store sells a few major brands in limited quantity as well. They don't have everything but are good at what they do. Competitively priced. Supports the local community. Nice people.

Best place to get all types of athletic shoes! They have large sizes for women!

This is a nice local store with a great selection of swimming, running, and triathlon gear.  The GH house brand is a good quality and reasonably priced.  

Great experience. I went in looking for some tri-shorts and left with a number of other things. I'll be back the next time I'm in SLO.

Awesome customer service! Great products! I love the Aqua thermals for morning water aerobics workouts! 

========================================================
Lemos
Love the variety of pet items it has! Service was great and friendly.

Selection very healthy seeming for animals, which is very important. Lots of special diet options. They even offered to order stuff for us if they don't have it in stock! Not as many good retractable leash options. Promised it wouldn't break like the other kinds from other shops, but it did in just a few months, too. Smaller, but great local family pet store!!! I like to come here when I can get down to that side of town 

This is a local chain pet feed & supply business that has an excellent selection of products for your pets. Most if not all of the staff seem to be fairly knowledgeable. 

Awesome place for nice and healthy dog and cat food! Also great customer service!

Good selection and a really friendly, knowledgeable staff.

Disinterested and unhelpful employees.  Shoes and gear that can be found elsewhere at better prices.  Location is phenomenal; they should have a  ton of shoppers.  Won't be going back.

Great selection and staff is always ready to grab you a size

Great customer service. They offer to help right away and are knowledgeable. They layout is nice and open and they have a great selection.

Great customer service. Ariel is the best!! She's so personable. 
She showed me some Jordan 5's & some Jordan shiznits. (I'm sure I got that wrong). She helped me decide on the J-5's. Anyway it was definitely a pleasure meeting & speaking with her. Shoe Palace is very lucky to have her. No doubt I'd shop there again. The rest of the staff was great as well. It's obvious they share the same values as Ariel, regarding customer service.
Update:
Went back the next day & bought the shiznits!

Decent ish shoe selection, not my favorite though.

Laguna Middle School
Great Middle School my son had a great time there. Because it is one of the only public Middle School in SLO it has a lot of people. Tip: get your child to school 20-10 minutes early to avoid traffic so you can get in and out quickly.

This is my 6th year @ LAMS. In that time I‚Äôve noticed that when a worn down teacher retires they‚Äôre replaced with another one who LOVES TEACHING. I‚Äôm happy that both my children went to school here. Yes, we all love our Fridays, but I don‚Äôt see anyone dreading Monday.

Im an 8th grader at LAMS and most of my 6 teachers are awesome.

a great school with administration and teachers who really care about the success of the students.

Mainly veteran staff. Great activities, sports, clubs.

Takken Enterprises Wherehouse
I had a very negative experience with someone outside of Takken Shoes insisting that I re-park before finding out whether or not I was a client.  He walked up to my car before I had turned off the car and told me to park somewhere else, that I was impeding his business by parking there.  There we many other open parking places nearby. Unfortunately he did not leave a good impression of him or his business with me and I will never shop at Takken Shoes. 

========================================================
Takkens - Shoes | Boots | Sandals
Takken's is awesome. Their staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and will go out of their way to help you find what you need. When I needed a heel repair a while back, a friend recommended Takken's and I called them and even though their cobbler wasn't going to be able to get the repair done in the time I needed (it was totally my fault waiting until 2 days before the event) they were happy to suggest other places that may be less booked and able to get the repair done by the time I needed it. It was a life saver. Thank you Takken's!

Very disappointing visit. Wanted to return an item bought there, but store manager said he didn't sell this item, although they were clearly on the shelf. Poor customer service. No attempt toale it right.

Friendly staff and good selection of brands, been going there for work boots since the 90's


Been shopping here now for 6 years and plan to keep coming here for my repair work.

I get most of my shoes here. Friendly staff who give you all the time you need with no rush.  I have to be able to actually try the shoes on for comfort and Takkens allows that. Plus their prices are competitive and my dollars stay local.

University Square
This is a great plaza with several places to eat and shop. Watch out for the 2 Hour Free parking. The Plaza Security will tow vehicles left and right.

Way crowded! A lot of rich college kids

An uncrowded small shopping center near me.

This small "hidden" mall appeals more to the Cal-Poly U crowd (students & staff), but it also can appeal to others.  The main anchor store, which is a Lassen's Market (an upscale gourmet/ health food market), boasts a good healthy hot/cold bar.  There are a range of other stores here as well. These range from a Credit Union, to fast food, to a bar/restaurant, to a coffee shop, to a gym, to a Rite Aid, and more.  All in all, a good pit-siop for those who work in the area, or are passing by on Hwy # 1....there is nothing like this on the 1 for the next few hundred miles...until you get to Carmel!!!

Lots of stores to offer!

========================================================
Central Coast Plaza Shopping Center
Not much there. Good I guess because it's not crowded, but I don't think SLO wants something like this. Loses its small town feel.

A really big strip mall with a lot of parking and room for larger vehicles. A very good selection of stores and restaurants. The property is well kept, has very good lighting at night. Have also seen security patrols around the parking lot.  There is also an Embassy suites hotel in the back of the property .

A great lounge with excellent acoustics. Not loud even though it is full of people. Super bar food.

A run down ghost town of a shopping center, calling it a "mall" is comical at best. 
The businesses that remain, ($$ Store, Payless Shoes, Bed Bath and Beyond... ) are staffed by a predictable collection of individuals who boast having mastered both apathy and downright abusiveness. To be able to juggle both traits simultaneously takes true talent - a talent I have seen demonstrated enough for one lifetime.

Convenient freeway access. Lots of easy parking for trailers and RVs.  Good food options in the immediate area.

========================================================
The Network Shopping Center
A very high end boutique shopping experience here!   Very relaxing atmosphere when walking in this shopping center.

Irish. Eire. Kristin(sp?). Secret Garden. organic herbs. go around back, behind the birkenstock sandal shop. quiet. grounded. ancient feeling. R

Very quaint historic western shopping towns that truly represent the culture of the central California coast

This shopping center is very charming and nice. It has restrooms, a beautiful amphitheatre that is available for rent, and lots of nice shops and restaurants. Lula Red is located here, and the whole center is very inviting.


It's a little more than historic.

Ralph's is pretty much the only reason I got but they got a lot of other business.
None that I use anyone asks due to Amozon prime and laziness

Nice plaza. Has lots of food options. Currently under construction so driving around is a bit tough but still nice.

I stayed next to the mall that looks like it's going through some changes. Forever 21 is gone. Sears is gone. But  you still have Best Buys, Bed Bath and Beyond.  Ralph's, Cost Plus World Market

Great plaza, groceries to wardrobe, to beauty, to electronics. Has something for all shoppers. Convenient parking

Available parking. Ralph's is clean, produce is fresh & affordable. Clerks and other employees take their jobs seriously, are courteous.

Max Relax - Chinese Reflexology & Accupressure
Very impressed with the level of professionalism all of your employees exhibit! Great prices and amazing massage just what I needed! Only thing that would have made it perfect is if the guy I had today around 1p didn't burp and grunt while I was giving the massage! Enjoyed the techniqes and private room. Will be back!

This was just an absolutely unbelievable 30 minute massage I called up and they took me immediately when my back hurt. They were so nice and helpful and it was a very relaxing quiet atmosphere even though it's right next-door to a 7-Eleven.

Fantastic, inexpensive Chinese massage parlor. I got a 60 minute foot massage that included a great neck, shoulder, and scalp massage while my feet were soaking, and again during the last 5 or 10 minutes of the session. For only $35! It's very nicely maintained, the people working there are nice, and prices unbeatable.  I highly recommend this place, and will be back

Not bad. I went in to get an  accupunture massage as listed on their menu, but instead I received a deep tissue massage that was good, but it wasn't what I've asked for.

Now that I something to compare it to.. Nice and quiet. Private room. Very good massage. I would recommend to anyone. Much better than another place I went to today.

Annie Laurie Whole Body Therapy and SLO Massage
This is probably one of the most fun massage therapists that I've ever had (I'm a chatty type, tho she does respect it when you get quiet). Annie is what I would call a naturopathic massage therapist. She uses all natural essential oils, some of which are very expensive, and tries to focus on which oils will be best for you, as an individual. If you enjoy all the smells of Massage, you're going to love her. The massage I had was relaxing and she was very professional throughout. She has more than 20 years of experience. For those of you who are interested in a massage therapist's pressure or style when reading a review: I was really surprised that I feel just as good as, if not better than, when I get a sports massage style masseuse. I didn't know a massage didn't have to hurt you in order to make you feel relief from knots and tightness. Went to see her because I was having severe cervical neck pain. I don't really buy into the whole fufu hippie 'oils will heal your body' thing--because science--but I do believe in the physiological evidence for massage and Annie has a gift for it. I'm not sore at all and I barely felt discomfort while she was working out knots (honestly, I didn't think she applied enough pressure, but maybe it was the muscle relaxing oil because, wow. ). She wrapped up my massage with a lymphatic drainage. I'm in a lot less pain today than I've been in a month and I'm finally starting to feel more like myself again. Thank you, Annie! Oh, and her rates are very reasonable. I can't afford most massage therapists, but I can afford Annie. I did a 90-minute.

Annie was wonderful. My husband and I went to her for a couple's massage. I had a recent car accident in September, and she was so considerate of my particular tender spots on my neck and back. She was thorough and gentle. I felt the most relaxed than I have ever felt before after the massage, I will be definitely going to her again soon

Great experience, knowledgeable and informative

Annie Laurie is the best! Hands down the most intuitive and effective healer in the region. Her holistic approach to whole body therapy is amazing and what makes her standout.  

Fantastic!
I received a massage from her then decided to get a chiropractic back adjustment from dr. Backmann, who luckily fit me in spur of the moment, and I can say that I have gone 5 months back pain free using this combo!

Rejuvenation Medical Skincare
The staff was rude! I was scheduled for a surgery and they demanded payment before I even saw the Dr. to go over procedure. They don't care about anything but making money. I had the surgery done by Dr. Bukachevsky's. His staff and experience was awesome start to finish.

Didn't even make it past the reviews.

Dr laumbergh is not very professional and his desk staff called Martin towing  to have this poor army veterans car towed that was visiting the same building Dr   dermatologist was in.  the poor guys dog was in the towed vehicle..! To bad most vetetans cant see a dermatologist.  If you can go anywhere else for there svs do it!!7  I still have the skin infection he was supposed to treat

dr. abroms is one of the fakest dr's i have ever met she...does not care about the customers satisfaction but instead seems to care about offering you treatments to take your money.
i had an ipl done by her and she also burned me. 
i have seen another derm. and now he has to help me to remove the scars she has left me with.....which will be very costly.

We visited the park right next to the stadium. If your kids are young its a great playground! My kids love the grass sliding hill and long slides. Go on a weekday to avoid crowds. Beautifully designed, and the only free zip line you'll find in the county!

A great place to watch the Blues play. Good selection of beer and wine good snack shack food and a fun time for all.

The cardboard sledding hill was a wonderful surprise!!

Love the Blues! A good SLO classic. Good price,  family fun, a summer must.

Got a massage by Jen as a gift from a friend. It was by far the best massage I've ever had. The people are amazing, the environment is super relaxing and Jen knows what she's doing. I highly recommend this place! Thanks again Jen

Thank you, Michael, for creating a unique massage that turned my muscles to jello. I highly recommend the infrared spa, it was the perfect temperature!

Professional, relaxing, inviting. Impeccable customer service and out-of-this-world massage. Jen is amazingly talented and really took her time to do the little extras that make a massage/spa experience noteworthy. If I'm ever back in SLO again I will definitely come here again, and will highly recommend to others. Exactly what a massage and spa experience should be. Thank you Jen and Ryan at the front desk, for making this such an enjoyable experience!

Nothing but positive things to say about this place!
I bought my mom a massage for Mother's Day and she couldn't have been more pleased. The staff are extremely friendly and make you feel comfortable the second you walk through the door.
In my mom's own words, "I am definitely going back to that place!"
Thank you, SLOCO :)

My husband and I had a great stay @ the health spa. The location is very easy to find and It's a nice short walk from the main street. They received us with two glasses of Kambucha tea to start detoxing, delicious! The apartment is really spacious and clean and they really care about maintaining a chemical free environment which we really appreciate. The BED is just amazing, we had never heard of an Orgone bed before and we were really excited to try it, it is made of Amethyst crystals and it's warm, comfy, and an experience on itself. Overall we had a wonderful stay. Thank you guys for everything. Nerea and J.

This was my first session with Sarah, and I have to say that she is so intuitive and it felt like she was able to just zoom in and target all of my knots and tight spots!  Applied exactly my preferred pressure/style.  Afterwards, I actually had to just sit and hang out for a bit in my car, as I was in such a post-massage super chill blissed out state!  I will definitely book again.

Emily is awesome! Best facials around and Emily is great with giving advice for how to better your skin on a day to day basis.

Sarah was amazing. Thank you for fitting me in on short notice. I love the atmosphere is super relaxing. I can't wait till my next visit.

I've had massages from all over the world--this was the best ever.  It's a great environment---friendly--with a killer smile--great conversation by a well educated --well traveled woman with great skills :)

Emily is awesome!

Very friendly staff. Call the head to find out information about having a few boxes of personal information shredded was very forthcoming and helpful on the phone. Even explain where they were in San Luis Obispo. While it was a little difficult to find well worth it. When in the office explain to me I was there to have a few boxes shredded they sent a gentleman out with a cart to collect my boxes. Filled out some paperwork paid and left in less than 10minutes. Cost me $9 a box to shred.

Very courteous, friendly, helpful, and professional staff!

Rose Garden Inn
I would have given the hotel 2.5 stars because the beds were comfortable, the towels we're nice and it was fairly quiet. The website states it's a non smoking environment. People above us smoked cigarettes on their balcony every half hour or so then threw the butts on the grass area. Because of that we were unable to open our sliding glass door to air out the room which smelled of too much cleaner. Also, right outside our sliding door was an accumulation of many cig butts. The smell of cigarettes was everywhere. Because of that we will never stay here again. Our TV kept malfunctioning though front staff quickly came to try and fix.

Nice place off Hwy 101. Needed a place to stay, the staff were very accommodating. Fast check in w/o a reservation. Breakfast included. Will be staying there again

I had a great stay at this clean, friendly, and quiet motel. They offer a continental breakfast oh and indoor room entrances I really loved. The carpet made me feel right at home. Swimming pool And Spa to sooth those aches and pains at the end of a hard day, what more could you ask for...I give it a cool 5 stars!!!!

For $60 a night this place is totally worth it good accommodation good cable with all the channels and the best part the two queen beds were super comfortable the showers are great the pool is nice the spa is fantastic and you're nearby a lot of great restaurants and downtown San Luis Obispo I will definitely make this place my go-to when I'm in the Coast. My kids totally enjoyed their stay here as well.

Good, low end motel/hotel, clean rooms and a pool and hot tub that are high quality, and very nice staff.

Karen fixed my hair for free from a bad cut at a salon school. I walked out beautifully quaffed.

I go to Kalyn to get my eyebrows colored and waxed and she is phenomenal.  She is a sweetheart, always professional, and has helped my eyebrows look so much fuller and shaped.  I have also had a few hair treatments and I highly recommend any service from her!

This is by far the BEST salon I have ever been to! I have been to both locations, and all stylists (I've had 3) are professional, nice, and very skilled. They fixed my hair after a botched home dye job and gave me the exact color I wanted (I literally pointed to a girl on the street and they matched the color!). They also know how to cut curly hair (which anyone with curly hair knows how hard it is to find a stylist that can do this!). I would recommend this salon to anyone and everyone. Plus, I think their prices are very fair. They also use Aveda products, which are naturally derived- cool, right?! I have never trusted salons before salon lux (again, curly hair) but am looking forward to my next visit. 

Great Salon, friendly staff, and yummy tea or coffee is complimentary. Kelsey is a wonderful stylist! 

Love this place!!! Go see Natalie she's great at hi-lights and achieves the perfect blonde!!!!!! Love love love her  !!!!

Old fashioned feel to the stadium, real grass, small and local. Wish they sold beer but the snack stand has some pretty good food, tri-tip, dogs etc. 

Parking and dealing with Cal Poly always sucks, but this is a great little stadium, nonetheless.

Oh man is the food bad here. Nachos literally had no cheese on them, just sad cold chips. The students running the food are derpin pretty hard. 

Great place to see a Cal Poly Football or soccer game 

Very clean & well maintained.

Mission Animal Hospital
Dr Kevin and his staff are over-the-top superior in their standard practice.  They really care about you and your pet. From the time you walk into the door to even days afterwards, they follow up. I‚Äôve never had a veterinarian clinic who even share one-half to the Nth degree information about the happenings with my precious pet whether Having a routine visit,  teeth cleaning or surgery.  But here at Mission, this is Standard Operating Procedures.  Because I love this place too, all of my needed pet vaccinations are free. 

Let me share this with you!   Recently, one of my babies (a rescue) was involved in a tiff at home, over food of all things, which ended in a broken bone. Dr. Kevin was immediately onboard, even on his day off!  I‚Äôm not kidding. He came in with his comfortable t-shirt and shorts to splint her leg until surgery could be performed in the next couple of days. After surgery, my dog was rarely uncomfortable! This speak volumes regarding the quality of surgery she received. Included in my surgery we‚Äôre 10 sessions of laser treatments to speed up and increase the quality of her healing. If you‚Äôve ever researched the price of laser....  Ten treatments included in the price of my surgery. WOW! And his staff are knowledgeable and sweet.  You don‚Äôt see a turn-over here either.  I‚Äôm getting to know all of them well now! Two weeks post surgery, except for her stitches and ‚ÄúCone of Shame,‚Äù you wouldn‚Äôt know mentally or emotionally that this dog had a major surgery.  Serious. She‚Äôs ready to conquer the world again, this time leaving Lucy‚Äôs food alone.

In a nutshell, if you care about your pet and the quality of care he/she receives, I highly recommend Mission Animal Hospital for all of your needs.  You‚Äôll find them right next to Trader Joe‚Äôs.  I‚Äôve been an extremely happy customer since just after they opened.  I became a customer when one client of mine after another kept raving about this place. My turn to rave!  Come check this place out!  You won‚Äôt be disappointed.

First time here today and this was the best experience I've ever had at a veterinarian.  The staff was attentive and fun to be around, the place was beautiful and comfortable.  The vet cleaned my cat's teeth and had to pull a few.  He kept me informed the whole way and even went over the x-rays with me.  Very professional.  This place gets rave reviews and I see why.  Great website too.

I worked in a veterinary clinic for 6 years and I am very impressed with the patient (and owner) experience Mission Animal Hospital provides.  They have taken excellent care of our aging dogs (currently 14, 14, and 12 years old).  

Our beagle has had a weeping tumor removed from behind his ear several times in the past, and I have had other vets tell me it is no longer operable.  Due to his age, I didn't really want to put him through another surgery anyway.  One of the vets at Mission Animal Hospital recommended a holistic approach and we started him on Transcend (a dietary supplement).  After a few weeks of him taking it, I noticed the tumor started to shrink and was not as weepy.  We are now on our second bottle, and although the tumor is still there, it is much more manageable, and is about 1/3 the size it was when he started taking the supplement.

I appreciate the thoroughness of the evaluations and the open-minded approach I feel the vets have taken with my dogs.  I like that they offer holistic options alongside modern medical procedures.  It's like the best of both worlds!  Thank you Mission Animal Hospital!

Poor information over the phone. Poor service and very expensive. Do your research and go prepared. I saw Dr. Julie. Went for an annual exam found out cat had tics in her ear. Cost me $178 total with treatment.

Such an awesome group of people! Sheldon Cooper (our dog) love visiting and always gets great care!

Affordable,  clean and safe. Attentive customer service.

What i like best about this facility is the customer service.  They are great, I have been renting for about a year, and i am still treated the same as the day i rented my unit. The place is kept extremely clean inside and out, and they have their managers residence on site, this gives me extra peace of mind. I am glad i rented here.   

Friendly, helpful staff and nice facility.

Awesome storage!

Thank you Tennis Warehouse,

Slo City Storage
Painless rental process. Went in, got the unit, and moved out less than a month later. Bob was a straightforward guy and knew his stuff. Safe enough and clean grounds away from the bustle of the town. 

Unfriendly staff and not wanting to hire friendly staff according to the staff. When I say staff I mean the one guy behind the counter. The only guy I've seen there. Expensive he says to keep the homeless and the bottom feeders out!??? I wasn't aware the the homeless or "bottom feeders" had extra money for a storage unit.  Not recommended. Now if the owners of this place out a little now hiring live in staff in the door of the restroom I would apply and if hired I'd turn that place around in the best interest of the owner and they would get all positive feedback because without customers they are not a business anymore!! Just saying üòé 

It's cool. They aren't nosy

Laguna Veterinary Care
The best vet in SLO! They have special rooms for cats. Acupuncture, surgery, full x ray service. Friendly staff, and a caring Doctor. ‚ù§

The best care...loving, kind, sensitive & skilled.  Even my most skittish rescues are relaxed in this atmosphere.

I love the fear-free philosophy of Dr. Hasan!  Her kind and gentle approach has completely won over my German Shepherd puppy, who had a traumatic experience elsewhere.  I can not say enough good things about the care and compassion at this wonderful place.

Laguna Veterinary Care is the most beautiful veterinary hospital I have ever seen, and Dr. Hassan and her staff have personalities to match. My cat is usually wonderful at home and a complete menace at veterinary hospitals (scratching people, yelling, unable to be held), but when I took him to see Dr. Hassan last week, he was calm from the moment he came into the hospital, until the moment he left. She won him over with treats and her calm way. She had a heating pad in the exam room that he loved and he even laid still for a blood test while one of her assistants fed him treats! Thanks to Dr. Hassan, now I know my little guy can be just as good at the vet as he is at home!

The staff at this office understands the importance of providing a stress-free atmosphere, quick admittance, and one-on-one personal care for your pet. I was seen by the doctor within 2 minutes of my scheduled appointment and Dr. Kholood Hassan immediately started showing my puppy affection, making sure she was completely accepting of the vet office on her first visit. Dr. Hassan provided my new pup with treats as she continued with her work and answered all of my questions. It was very refreshing to hear her share a lot of the same mentalities I have on responsibilities of pet ownership and when there is an opportunity to save a few extra dollars without negatively impacting your pet's health. After finishing taking care of my pup Dr. Hassan gave me a tour of the facility and spoke about her capabilities as well as her inabilities/limitations which I appreciated very much. It shows a lot of trust between doctor and client as well as a sense of pride by the owner in her practice. I am very happy with my first visit to Laguna Veterinary Hospital and I definitely plan on returning with Dr. Hassan as my puppy's primary veterinarian. Thank you to Dr. Hassan and her caring staff!

Academy Travel Consultants
Dianne could not handle planning a Destination Wedding Cruise for myself and my 50 guests. She was very unorganized, continuously got our names wrong, booked with incorrect spelling of names, (kind of important for international travel) She would not return phone calls in a timely manner, she did not mail out invoices to my guests as they booked as promised. She quoted us a $25 deposit to book a cabin but then changed it to $100 with no explanation. She attempted to create a "wedding flyer" with all the pricing and cruise info for my guests. The flyer looked like a child make it and was confusing. She had to change this flyer at least three times which caused issues for me trying to create "Save the Dates" and a wedding website. When I told her how displeased I was with her service and that all of my guests had complained to me about her, I ask her to release my group reservation to a different agent. She refused. Myself and ALL my guests asked her in writing to cancel our group reservations and she tried to charge me a commission fee of $897 even though Carnival's policy is that all monies are refundable up to 45 days prior to sailing. She refuses to work with me to rectify the situation that she messed up. She even hung up on my new travel agent who was just trying to help fix the mess. Myself and all of my guests have had to now dispute the charges through our banks in order to get our money back just so can rebook with a new agent. Very disappointed, she is very unorganized with a lack of compassion and consideration for myself and my wedding party.

So helpful, I skipped first day of trip! Lol!

Am currently planning a trip to Italy with a friend.  No easy task since I'm using miles and flying from the west coast and she is buying her ticket and flying from the east coast.  In addition to the coordinating our same time arrival flight arrangements, we've asker her plan our 15 days in 4 cities.  I've been so impressed with the choices / options given to us.  I found the owner both personable and proffessional, clearly understanding the nuances of our wants.

Let's face it -- Travel is a hassle. The sheer indignity of airline screening, cramped seats, long, tedious flights. At least with Dianne it's an adventure where the essentials are taken care of. I've traveled several times with Diane and anticipate more adventures in the future. Steven in SLO

Bob Holzer Towing
Best AAA towing service in Santa Barbara 

My mom passed away in August and I hadn't quite figured out what to do with her car. Well, the SLOPD was going to have it towed. I hadn't realized that the car had been ticketed for being on the street for too long. I begged them not to tow the car, that I would make sure to handle it soon. The police said it was up to the tow truck guy who had already opened the hood (which was great because someone had backed into the car and not told me and I couldn't get the hood open to jump the car) and was almost ready to put it on the truck. The tow truck driver (handsome kid!) called his boss and they took pity on my tragedy and did not tow my late mothers car. They could have been jerks and taken the car since they had already used time and resources but they showed me compassion and I value that in a company. I would recommend them to anyone and will use their services whenever possible.

They don't tow vehicles

Silverado Stages San Luis Obispo
I wanted to take a moment to write a review to Silverado Stages charter bus company. Every charter bus in Los Angeles were sold out of the weekend of April 24,25,26. I was really struggling to find a charter bus from Los Angeles to Las Vegas roundtrip. I was so upset I thought i wasnt going to have a trip anymore. My sister recommended me Silverado Stages because her University used them a ton. I went ahead and gave them a call and I was transferred to Lauri Seitz. From the begining Lauri went above and beyond to help me plan my trip to Las Vegas. She mapped out everything for me for a great price. She emailed me all the paper work that i signed and returned to her and set my trip up in 1 day flat. Now lets talk about the bus i got. I swear the bus looked brand spanking new. I felt like i was on a Virgin America Plane. 47 passanger bus with restroom, Blizzard cold AC, Reclining seats, 2 power outlet in front of your seats, Large monitors for DVD's and awesome sound system for your music. I was so beyond impressed. All my family and friends loved the bus I swear it was like a Mercedes bus. My Bus Driver Ahmad Thompson a nice sweet driver. He put all our luggage in the storage units below the bus and drove us to Vegas. He was wonderful i will request him on my next trip. I cannot stop thanking Lauri and Ahmad for making my trip happen. I was very scared at first to book them but at the end of my trip i felt like they are family friends to me.

I have been calling for several days now, with no response in regards to a refund for my ticket. My schedule was broken and I am unable to use the ticket that I purchased. If this is the quality of Silverado Stages customer care, I would advise travelers to seek transportation elsewhere.

I was vacationing in San Francisco to see the 49ers game. Our bus was 2 hrs late and we missed the national anthem, kickoff, and the entire game day experience. The driver was unapologetic, and I was offered $5 for compensation. I will never use them again.

We took a Silverado Stages Tour to the Getty Villa recently. The bus was clean and seats really comfortable. The driver was nice and the tour was a lot of fun. My daughter loved spending the time WITH me as opposed to in the back of the car. I will definitely do this again soon, a much nicer alternative to dealing with traffic!

Mustang Village Apartments
I really enjoy the studio I am in. It's very quiet and close to campus which is a big plus. The laundry rooms, however, could be better. It's very humid and crowded in there, with very little space to move around in order to take care of clothing. Most of the machines have mold in them, which is a health hazard to all tenants who use the machines. I've visited to laundry sites and they all have the same issues. The mold issue is a problem because the users close the door right after washing (allowing the hot water to cause bacteria to grow). If maintenance could perhaps clean the washers often, that would be great. Dryers are fine since they are hot and dry (evidently) which prevent bacterial growth. Other than that, Mustang is great for the price and location. The pools are well maintained, the study room is great, and I can't appreciate how quiet it is where I am (in the back near the stadium).

They are always trying to over charge me and I have to fight with them every time to get my money back. I already switched my electricity over to PG&E and mustang is still trying to charge me for that too. The apartments are alright but be prepared to fight in order to not get ripped off.

Awful!
My roommates and I spent all of winter quarter dealing with an issue that should have been resolved relatively quickly if proper procedure had been followed from the start. Right when we returned from winter break, we came home to find our apartment flooded. They came and mopped it, but did nothing to prevent the issue from happening again. The second time it flooded they mopped once more and started talking about what they could do to solve it, but did nothing until the third time it flooded which was the worst time. Our entire apartment was covered with at least an inch of water. Don't get me wrong, the maintenance people are really nice and try their best to solve the issues, but it was obviously a task that should be handled by a professional. We got put up in a hotel for two nights, while they dried out our apartment and put new floors in. In typical Mustang Village fashion, they laid new floor over the old floor. Us being college students with no construction background at all could tell you that wasn't going to work, because the old flooring was cheap and absolutely soaked through. The flooding problem was eventually fixed, but a few days later we found mold all along our wall. Again, they didn't bring in professionals but just had their maintenance team try to handle the task.They knocked down the wall and put a new one up. Unsurprisingly, the mold came back. They were about to just knock down the wall again when we called in a city health inspector, who finally got them to listen, and they finally brought in professional. As you must do with mold, they blocked off much of our lower portion of our apartment to dry out the walls, which finally solved the problem. The professionals also found out about the flooring and thought it was ridiculous that they had just installed the new floors over the old floors. 
Random funny anecdote, the health inspector taped a notice on our door that they had to deal with the mold issue and the manager GAVE US A VANDALISM CITATION!!!

Anyway, the manager Justin Epperly is a complete asshole, who will not try to work with you to solve issues, and will lie to you about how much money he will give you so that you can stay in a hotel while they try to fix the issue for the umpteenth time. 
If you don't have to deal with management or any major construction issues, maybe you'll be fine. I don't know, but I sure as hell would advise you not to come near Mustang Village.

This place is literally the worst. Unfortunately I lived here for 2 years due to its close proximity to campus. That's the only good thing about this place. Rude staff. Parking is impossible. Thin walls, thin floors, unbelievably noisy. It's torture sometimes. They also raised my rent in just TWO years from 750/month to 1,045/month. Again, I cannot emphasize enough just how rude and unresponsive their staff is. Never live here.

I was very disappointed by the state of disrepair in our apartment upon move-in. In addition to small scratches and dings around the unit, here were the most major problems that all existed before we arrived:
- Broken dishwasher.
- AC broken, and upon repair was noisy as it sprayed dust and rocks out the window.
- 20ft deep clog in toilet (we found out this was the problem after maintenance snaked it).
- Refrigerator covered in small dents on front, with back grate broken and wires spilling out. One day it turned off and we had to fiddle with the wires to get it working again.
- Our unit was the only Townhome with carpeting downstairs, and it appeared to be covering an odd lump under the floor. There was a small nail protruding from beneath the edge of the carpet just far enough to poke a foot and snag on socks. This also made cleaning a lot harder because we planned for a hardwood floor with a non-carpet vacuum.
- Lots of dust beneath all of the beds, as if the cleaning crew had barely slept over there surface and just ignored all of the places that were hard to reach. 
- One of the bulbs in the kitchen was burned out, making our apartment very dim, especially in combination with the dark carpet.
- There were holes torn in the backs of both couches.

Because more things seemed to be broken than in good condition upon move-in, I have a very low opinion of Mustang. In addition, there have been incidents where they accidentally billed for an extra month that affected several renters. I do not look forward to move out, because I would not be surprised if they try to charge me claiming I broke all of the aforementioned appliances. Other people were less unlucky than us, but be aware that it can be as bad as our experience.

A place you can get everything done. I Bank there as well get my food. Oh let's not forget my flowers. The best price on flowers are at Ralph's. The most helpful people ever. All around the best store to shop at in San Luis Obispo

Good food and deli open late.  Helpful associates.

A quick stop for groceries and fast service at the cash register. Store was clean, well organized, and plenty products to chose from. Overall, a pleasant experience.

JUST love this store. I shop only hear. Every one of the clerks are the very best at this place. Thank you for your help.

Nice selection, polite employees, not the cheapest place, but clean and frindly. Wish this store in SLO would have signs outside stating no bag policy in town. I could have brought bags.

Thank you to the parents who send their friendly, happy, respectful children to CalPoly. For the most part they are good for the town and neighborhoods. I miss them in the summer, and welcome the excitement when they return in the fall. This, of course only applies to the friendly, happy, respectful students!! üòä

Beautiful campus.  We always have a pleasant experience every time to visit the campus.  From students to staffs are so friendly and courteous.

Lack of support for the students is ridiculous. Students should be allowed to enroll in the classes they need. Cal Poly needs to hire more professors so students can graduate on time. This is an issue that needs to be addressed. An issue, that is long over due.

Friendly staff and Dr Longabach was patient with me and level headed.  He didn't try to sell me any services I didn't need, and when it was time to pay, they were very generous with me since I have an adopted feline.  There was no wait time.

The group i volunteer with, the Cal Poly Cat Program, has been taking all of our cats to Doc for as long as any of us can remember. He sometimes sees five or more cats from us each week, and is absolutely amazing with all of them. He's been extremely friendly and understanding and the staff there has always gone out of their way to help us with things we need. This isn't just a review for a single cat, but for the hundreds of cats that they've seen from us over the years.
 
If we can trust them with all of our animals, you can trust them with your personal ones. :)

Dr. Longabach is a calm, patient and compassionate vet. His staff is engaged and caring and his offices are spic and span clean. We have been taking our two cats there since 2010. One of our cats was born with a severe heart murmur which until recently had been asymptomatic. In the last month it became an issue. The Doc examined and determined that Tabitha had a build-up of fluid in her lung cavity and prescribed a simple diuretic. In less than four days time she has stabilized and is happy. Thank goodness that we have a vet who gets to the heart of the problem (pardon the pun) without over-treating and causing undue expense. 

Caring, compassionate, thorough and very professional.
Dr. Longabach is amazing and very thoughtful and informative. He REALLY seems to care about our pets and that makes such a difference.

His staff are fantastic too.

I highly recommend!

We visited SLO region for the first time and wanted to explore local vineyards not knowing much details. So we came to visitor centre and got great guidance and the warmest welcome by Keri. She basically made a whole day program around the vineyards for us so we didn't have to look for anything and waste time. So helpful and friendly! Thank you Keri! SLO is beautiful!

They have so much information on great activities to do here on the Central Coast. I've been born and raised here and I still learned about some new and fun activities.

Nice friendly tourism helper.  If you are a tourist you should come here first.

Very helpful people gave us some great personalized advice. Lot of maps and other resources in the store.

Just moved to town. Went looking for help on things to do and places to see. Staff was friendly and helpful!

Good vet, small shop. No overnight boarding.

At last, a pet vet that doesn't charge a fortune for walking through the front door.  Dr. Mimi was kind, efficient, helpful, and made our kitten happy and healthy.  No expensive tests, no nonsense.  It was a great experience.

Most kind gentle staff we have ever taken our dogs to!
They are very through and concerned with needs of patients and "parents".

We had great experiences with all of the vets and staff.  They really took care of my cat Alice and I am so grateful.

Great experience with the Vet and staff, they were so wonderful to my dog and easy to work with. I'm sorry to have to change vets due to moving.

Kiowa and I popped in on Saturday without an appointment for a quick vaccination (as they suggested we do), and we got there around 10:20 am and they were slammed (since they were closing at 11 am).  Well the receptionist (Katie?) was awesome, a real multi-tasker and the whole crew was exceptional.  The tone of the waiting room was very positive, and although it took about 40-45 min to get out of there, it was really a fun experience.  Nice people waiting, nice pets and a great staff - at a great price.


Our dog has had two bouts of pancreantitis in the past couple of months, On both occasions, the office made room for us to bring her in on short notice, provided a swift and accurate diagnosis, and arranged for overnight care immediately. While it's not inexpensive, the professionalism and friendliness demonstrated toward us and our dog provided reassurance at very worrisome times. This is the best vet in San Luis Obispo, in our opinion!

I found the staff to be very friendly and courteous. They were genuinely interested in our dog and informative about their vacinations. I will return there.

IF YOU WANT A VET WHO PUTS CARE FIRST, DO NOT USE THIS VET!

We took a healthy 20-week-old kitten to Stenner Creek A.H. to be neutered. The following days he displayed a lack of appetite, thirst & energy. Worsened, he felt hot and shivered. Took him back for a follow up. Before Dr. came into exam room, staff member (RVT Erin) rudely queried, "how much can we pay today". I asked, "How much could we be looking at?" answered my question by repeating her question again. I gave a figure and stated that this was inappropriate timing for this conversation. I felt at the time if I had said $500, fees would be $500; if I had said $700, fees would be $700.

Dr. Examined the kitten, diagnosis was that kitten had a bite infection. Course of action would be an antibiotic injection with subcutaneous fluid. Afterwards the Dr. said if he is not getting better in 36 hours to call him right away. He did not get better; we called to arrange a follow up. The Drs. RVT "Erin" told us that the Dr. would not see our kitten until our balance was paid. She was rude to my wife and to me. Anytime we tried to ask a question she would interrupt and talk over us. My wife and I tried to have a rational conversation with this woman, however she just would not allow that to be. We asked to speak to the Dr. that was not an option; we inquired if she was the office manager, she replied ‚Äúone of them.‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúIs this direction of the Dr.‚Äù she replied, ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. I felt I was lied to and that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to talk to the Dr. We ended the phone call with her promise to return our call. She never did. Erin's focus was on money, not the fact that our kitten may be ill, in pain or even die. 

Over the last 30 days we had paid 100% of costs to vaccinate two animals, neuter one with a follow up visit. We had put aside the funds to spay our female kitten in just a couple days and even had an appointment scheduled, over $500 in fees. Including an additional $10 toward the outstanding balance.

True we had an outstanding balance of $280 from previous animal care the Dr. had provided. We had been making monthly payments. Due to unemployment, I hadn't made a payment in several months. However I had full intentions too do so. His front office staff was aware of this and told us that a $10 to $20 a month payment would be fine, it wouldn't be a problem. We inquired about this in advance and made sure before scheduling any new appointments.

Subsequently went to a different vet. They were kind, compassionate & caring. Conducted blood test there at their facility and determined the issue. They gave him intravenous antibiotics and sent us home with an oral antibiotic. It‚Äôs been 12 hours and he has returned to almost normal.

Stenner Creek Animal Hospital is very dishonest and cares only about the amount of money they can suck out of people.

Charging ridiculous rates for unnecessary procedures, these people are scam artist.

Beware!

This is honestly one nicest most friendly place I have been. I called in late because I had been refused service AT Morron Bay to put my baby down. At my XXXXXXXXX VET  WHOAfter making the appointment she called and said they would not put my baby who was screaming in pain because I placed a negative comment on here. Any way they heard her pain and told to come now and this was after 5. They took to a sitting room with a comphy sofa. She left and gave us private time. At no time were we rushed. The Dr and assistant we're very compassionate and carring. I found the best vet around!

Cal Poly Dining
In comparison with UCLA's famous dining hall, Cal Poly dining has a ways to go, but compared to the average college dining, Cal Poly dining has a decent selection of both recognizable brands and campus brands, offering both healthy selection such as a full salad bar and indulgence selection like burgers and burritos. 

Pricing is towards the high end, especially considering most identical menus just off campus are easily 15-25% cheaper. Service speed could use improvemt but considering the number of students it must serve daily and the mainly student based work force, it gets a pass.

I don't see much faculty dining here, which can be a telltale for the overall sentiment towards dining hall. 

Food quality is decent overall, slightly above fast food quality, but not quite at a food truck level yet. There is a reasonable change in menu selection from year to year, with the essentials such as salads, sandwiches, and hamburgers remaining more or less the same.

Never left a negative review in my life but both the quality and the food itself is bad. Every time I come here, my stomach feels greasy and turny for at least till the next morning. This place should undergo health inspection, from the plates and cups looking half washed.

You would honestly have to put a concentrated effort to make food across an entire campus so uniformly bad and expensive. You'd think with all their money they could afford to provide something other than this garbage.

Cool place to hang out with friends and have a quick bite to eat on the way to classes.

literal trash

Animal Care Clinic
Sadly we had to put our 13 yr. old Sheltie to rest. Dr. Jones (Bisson), tried to determine the correct meds. always calling after a visit to check on her progress. Her ailment just got the best of her. Dr. Greenberg cared for her at the end. Upon bringing her in, she was declining so quickly, they were thoughtful enough to give her a little relaxant before she had the final injection. The Staff is amazing, always trying to accommodate timing best for our pets. We have been taking both of our dogs there for years now. I don't know how anyone could claim the staff is rude or uncaring. I have never observed any negativity while I was there. Even in chaos or how busy they are. The doctors, assistants and staff, have true empathy.

Very professional staff. My dog receives great care here.

They are great. Usually on time, super nice to my dog...even though she usually fear pee's on their floor.  And apparently one of their veterinarian's is ranked the best on the Central Coast.

Welcoming staff, expert care, and treats = happy dog.

My wife and I were very happy wit h the services provided to our two dogs.

O'Connor Pet Hospital
Doctor O'Connor is hands down the most experienced and gifted animal doctor in the world! From complex surgery to very difficult to diagnose internal medicine cases she has been correct with her diagnosis every single time. For the past 14 years Doc has cared for my 2 German Shepherds and 1 Belgian Shepherd. The Germans had surgery and hip issues that were cared for with knowledge and Skill, the Belgian had a VERY rare pancreatic disorder that NO other vet could even come close to diagnosing correctly. The Belgian has been on treatment successfully for 7 years and we both owe our quality of life and health to Doctor O'Connor. Pope Francis should make a stop in SLO the next time he us in US, because Doc is a true Saint!! Thank you Doc., David L. Pergrossi

Apparently the term "appointment" means nothing to this place. I hate to leave a bad review, as the staff seems nice and all, but come on! Every time we have been here we have waited well beyond our scheduled time. I'm talking 30+ minutes! I know you can get behind sometimes, but three appointments in a row?!? Unacceptable. We will not be going here any longer. 

Update: We now go to the Animal Care Clinic just off of Tank Farm Rd, and love it.

Worst Vet ever. Had 5 pets over the years we have taken to O'connor and every single problem any of our pets had they made us leave the pet over night (ALWAYS) the next day they come back absolutely filthy and they always say the same thing. For instance we had a pet with a bad food allergy and they never figured it out they kept saying that the skin rash was a ear infection. The pets are always starving when they get home on top of being absolutely (filthy from one night) we are never aloud to be there when they do the examination and they give you the same medication time after time for any problem. Took our pet to a new vet to see if they could find the problem causing the skin rash and they found it with in a few hours, after years of taking her to O'connor the new vet found and fixed the problem same day. I would never trust them with any animal ever. They are horrible. 

Doctor O'Connor has been taking care of our pets for 20 years.  We have never had anything other than great experiences.  The doc's pet knowledge is amazing and the staff is extremely caring.  Four paws up.

O'Connors' took the best care of my sick dog.  Very caring and knowledgeable.  Best vet we've had.
