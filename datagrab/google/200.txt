The salon is conveniently located on a quiet edge of downtown San Luis Obispo along the creek. The atmosphere is professional, relaxing, peaceful, and elegant. There is an authentic French touch as Patricia comes from a French family and had traveled to France many times. Also, her mother was a reputable esthetician in the bay area, so she has grown up south the practice of excellent skin care. The main product lines carried in the salon are Sothys (French) and Jan Marini (Californian). Both are excellent, and I use products from each line. Throughout the year Patricia organizes product events with company representatives that are always fun and informative, not to mention she always provides delicious and elegant high quality refreshments.

I was harrassed by Manny who likes to enforce rules that don't exist and he hates railroad photographers. I'll post the video soon-ish, search SLO Amtrak Manny with your favorite expletive and you'll find Manny. He's the reason this station lost three stars.","time":1490494488},{"author_name":"Stuart Greig","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117002497604781397370/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C-V7wzB76GU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/A1JegzruNMQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"9 months ago","text":"Quiet, friendly.

I could have showed you before it was washed, but now it's kind of hard to describe...  \n\nSherry always does an interview with you while your hair is combed in the style you walked in with -- and then after discussing what you want she takes you back to get it washed.\n\nShe's so good that lately I just tell her to do whatever she thinks looks good and every time it comes out great. She really pays attention to the little things that makes YOUR hair unique.\n\nConversation during the hair cut is never forced or awkward, it's very fun and natural, like we're sitting having coffee together.

This. Shop. \n\nI’ve purchased all of my bikes (4 treks, 2 surlys) and have had other bikes serviced here over the past 9 years, meaning I’ve done all kinds of business with them, and they’ve never missed an opportunity to exceed my expectations. \n\nOne of my favorite aspects of their service is the transparency. They’ve never glossed over something they didn’t want to explain because I’m not a bicycle expert- they’ve always taken the time to explain a problem or a solution before I decide to commit any money. And they’ve always managed to explain it in a way that shows their passion for their craft without making you feel clueless. \n\nOn the flip side of that, if you don’t want to know about the inner workings of your bottom bracket, they will simply take care of it in a very reasonable amount of time. \n\nSo if you’re in need of a quality shop for the purchasing and maintainence of your various bicycles, definitely go see Josh and his crew at Foothill Cyclery.","time":1514395268},{"author_name":"Charlotte Bemand","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106351631237866850432/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HDy90bc1xgo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT52Il5YL-hEqzvR2Rk0NWJpn-WFPQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"8 months ago","text":"Great service from super friendly and knowledgeable staff- I rented my first proper mountain bike, a demo Trek Fuel for just  $60 for the day.

The rep at Mercedes Financial spoke to his supervisor and Mercedes Financial is taking care of the last payment to make this right. I would highly suggest that in the future Alfano try and at least understand the perception of the customer instead of outright refusing to honor something that in my opinion was implied before I even purchased the new car. It's ridiculous that they would prefer I drive an hour and half for a $50 tank of gas (which would cost me $20 in gas round trip) rather than pay a $140 payment. I'm never going up there as I have no reason to drive that far to get gas, which means they lost me, anyone I might have referred and got a bad review all over $90.\n\nUpdate: Changing from 5 stars to 2 stars.\n\nWhen I called to inquire about the new car Jacob clearly asked me when the lease on my current vehicle ended. When I said I had one payment left he responded that it would be \"no problem\". I've turned in many leases that only had 1 or 2 payments left and I've always had the dealership pay off the lease since I was either leasing or buying another vehicle from them. Anyway, to make a long story short, I got a bill for the final payment, called and left a message with all the details so they could correct their oversight, then got a call back from Jacob telling me I must have misunderstood him. Why would I not have waited 3 more weeks to finish out my lease when I only had one payment left if I wasn't sure the dealership would pay the last payment? The payment was only $140...and on top of that the dealership owes me a tank of gas since my new car had less than a quarter tank when I drove off the lot. I live about an hour and half away from the dealership so there is no way I'm driving up there to fill my tank. And to really get me ticked off, Jacob mentioned they did me a huge favor in letting me mail them my second key for the car I turned in...but we're pretty much square on that in my eyes since they forgot to give me the second key for my new car and had to mail it to me. So for less than $100 they now have an offended and disappointed customer. I didn't want to get into an argument with Jacob so I hung up. I've called Mercedes Benz Financial to let them deal with it.\n_______________________________________________________________________  \nOriginal review:\n\nI called to come in and turn in my leased vehicle and also purchase a CPO C250 that I had pretty much already decided on. I spoke with Jacob a few times over the phone in advance and then drove up from Santa Barbara to work with him to purchase the car shortly after. Although he was new to the dealership he was very hospitable, honest, professional and quick. Was literally the fastest vehicle transaction I've ever experienced which is amazing considering I was also turning in a lease. Everyone I worked with was extremely helpful and went out of there way to accommodate me. I absolutely love my car and I 100% recommend them if you are in the market for a Mercedes!","time":1502738228},{"author_name":"cptrudeau","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101633391898529966151/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vwDkXJXjvWQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT4-X0O6wRPRZ7V_IZpu2pMJFruuyA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"Recently bought a E350 CPO convertible from these folks.

(Last time we had the car in, after several calls to them, they said this exact thing).  The representative said the part had just gotten in and did I wanted to have the part installed - so the phone would sync.  I said I would and that I had had no communication at all from Ford, I didn't know a part was needed.  He said it should be done soon and he would contact me.  On Monday morning (7 days later) I called and asked to talk with the representative for the car.  The receptionist said the car was done.  NO ONE NOTIFIED ME.  I asked to talk to a manager - I left a voice mail for him.  He did call me back, I was unable to answer and called him back.

My sister saw a sign that said Free gift for birthdays and first time in the store, she innocently asked if that applied to us, just being curious. The girl checking us out didn't know (she was very sweet) and she went to ask a guy with brown hair who was working on someone.

The service to temporarily repair the damage alone was more than the cars worth, and at 225k miles, it was not worth putting in a new engine. I walked through the whole lot with our salesman, Gil, and we found a great car that exactly fit my budget and needs. It had just been traded in and hadn’t even been fully processed. I’m a full time student and on my own financially, so it was huge that they were able to find something for me, especially something in my budget that I’m so happy with.

Periodically would not start -- acting like the battery dead. We had to jump-start it three times just before we were to leave on a trip of about 2500 miles, in the Winter.  We took it into Rancho Grande Service Department to try to find out what the problem was.  They actually did not find the issue, but replaced the original battery (which still tested very well - actually above expectations), with a stronger battery.  \n\nI actually believe the electrical issue is still with us, as evidenced by the fact, that about 200 miles into the trip, the electric clock on the instrument panel, froze at a given time.  At about 75 miles after the clock \nfroze, we stopped for gas.  I turned the engine off, and as a test, started the car again.  No problem starting, and the clock was reset.  Re-booting worked, but if we have a situation as occurred when the problem mentioned in the first paragraph above occurred again, we would need to jump start it. \n\nHowever, whether the electrical issue is still with us or not, I believe the \nService Department did what they could do, and that is appreciated.  I had a 2011 Outback, and they also did the service on that.  So far, I have found the Service Department has performed extremely well on both of our Outback vehicles.","time":1514498657},{"author_name":"Karen Silva","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112457533640357801091/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DFuj5zaY5rU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAlo/GHKAu2ComJY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Great service!

Let's start with the dealership. They kept me in the sales office, alone, until almost 7pm on a work night after I told them I needed to leave. Advertised a car online that didn't exist, only to tell me they could get a similar one by ordering from Arizona. After a week, they call to say that car was already sold. Okay, so why did it take a week to find that out?! I bought from another dealership since this one obviously uses bait and switch tactics. They tried to sell me a car for $5000 more that was nothing like the model I wanted.\n\nNow, onto service: for some reason, the airbag system is faulty in my vehicle. After *5 trips* and at least as many hours in their waiting room, I'm told that if the car continues to malfunction twice more, they would replace the entire electrical system (which, by the way, I said was the issue after the 3rd visit!)\n\nDid they follow through? Nope. Two visits later and they use the loophole technique to claim that it was a \"different airbag warning light\" and thus, negated their promise. Six months later, with no solution in sight, I get a recall notice from Nissan for...you guessed it...the airbag system. I won't even go into have them fix it because it's a complete waste of time.","time":1513379357},{"author_name":"Maria Hernandez-Garcia","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116412120111886257986/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-o_av5TylBbk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT4aZ8xm8PFsJ3HFfelhIXJ0SxhmUA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"WORST experience over the phone ever!!

I bought a 2003 Jetta from them, and 4 days off the lot, wouldn't you know it the check engine light came on.  I took it to get it checked out, and the cost to repair the car was more than half of what I paid for the whole car.\n\nI contacted heiland, hoping that they would help me out.  I mean, the check engine light coming on after less than 30 miles is pretty shady, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and an opportunity to help me out.  They offered me roughly 1/8th the cost of the repair, and wouldn't let me return it.  Now, these guys talk nice on the phone and were nice to me in person, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm paying 1.5 times the value of the car just to drive it again (by the way, the issue was with the transmission, making it unsafe to drive).\n\nI talked to 2 different mechanics, and I have it on record that if the car had been checked out, the issue would definitely have been found.  Heiland has repeatedly told me that they had the car checked out before they sold it.\n\nWhat I infer from this situation is that Heiland had a car on their lot with a transmission problem.  I'm betting that because it still ran, they cleared the check engine light, and put it on their lot waiting for someone to buy it.  The check engine light usually takes a few days or weeks to come back on, but hey there's only a 3-day return policy.\n\nThis is fraud, plain and simple, and I plan to prove it in court.  I have my testimonies, and I'm in the process of taking this to small claims.  When this gets resolved, I'll update this, but the point of this review is:  Even though they talk and act nice, DON'T TRUST THEM.  If you like a car on their lot, always get it checked out by a trusted mechanic before you make the final purchase, or just go somewhere else.","time":1352225290}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["car_dealer","store","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=4236420772816394878","utc_offset":-480,"vicinity":"3249 Broad Street, San Luis Obispo","website":"http://www.heilandautosales.com/","html_attributions":[]},{"address_components":[{"long_name":"1422","short_name":"1422","types":["street_number"]},{"long_name":"Monterey Street","short_name":"Monterey St","types":["route"]},{"long_name":"San Luis Obispo","short_name":"San Luis Obispo","types":["locality","political"]},{"long_name":"San Luis Obispo County","short_name":"San Luis Obispo County","types":["administrative_area_level_2","political"]},{"long_name":"California","short_name":"CA","types":["administrative_area_level_1","political"]},{"long_name":"United States","short_name":"US","types":["country","political"]},{"long_name":"93401","short_name":"93401","types":["postal_code"]}],"adr_address":"<span class=\"street-address\">1422 Monterey St</span>, <span class=\"locality\">San Luis Obispo</span>, <span class=\"region\">CA</span> <span class=\"postal-code\">93401</span>, <span class=\"country-name\">USA</span>","formatted_address":"1422 Monterey St, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401, USA","formatted_phone_number":"(805) 543-1148","geometry":{"location":{"lat":35.2858201,"lng":-120.65532559999997},"viewport":{"south":35.2843985697085,"west":-120.65660093029152,"north":35.28709653029149,"east":-120.6539029697085}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/shopping-71.png","id":"cea051a1f188d6d8d640efca64422cf99f90af48","international_phone_number":"+1 805-543-1148","name":"Cambria Bicycle Outfitter","opening_hours":{"open_now":true,"periods":[{"close":{"day":0,"time":"1600","hours":16,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516579200000},"open":{"day":0,"time":"1100","hours":11,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1517166000000}},{"close":{"day":1,"time":"1800","hours":18,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516672800000},"open":{"day":1,"time":"1000","hours":10,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516644000000}},{"close":{"day":2,"time":"1800","hours":18,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516759200000},"open":{"day":2,"time":"1000","hours":10,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516730400000}},{"close":{"day":3,"time":"1800","hours":18,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516845600000},"open":{"day":3,"time":"1000","hours":10,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516816800000}},{"close":{"day":4,"time":"1800","hours":18,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516932000000},"open":{"day":4,"time":"1000","hours":10,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516903200000}},{"close":{"day":5,"time":"1800","hours":18,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1517018400000},"open":{"day":5,"time":"1000","hours":10,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516989600000}},{"close":{"day":6,"time":"1700","hours":17,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1517101200000},"open":{"day":6,"time":"0930","hours":9,"minutes":30,"nextDate":1517074200000}}],"weekday_text":["Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Thursday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Friday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM","Saturday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM","Sunday: 11:00 AM – 4:00 PM"]},"photos":[{"height":5312,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/110941194368617598732/photos\">Matthew Kogan</a>"],"width":2988},{"height":5312,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/100382029944518211088/photos\">Kerry Oh</a>"],"width":2988},{"height":3265,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/111557884895470941076/photos\">Paul Malarik Jr</a>"],"width":4898},{"height":3264,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/113420314735434576048/photos\">Jared Serna</a>"],"width":2448},{"height":625,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/116790360815913495746/photos\">Cambria Bicycle Outfitter</a>"],"width":625}],"place_id":"ChIJW4i3Ogbx7IAR4FuZN0I7Trc","rating":3.9,"reference":"CmRSAAAA2CzVt66d7y9jseWharb9K6GmOu8MYhKPH1voYuuft8SV2sv6AB6YM485cxBVYd7MNm8iO6aezfgxxX8GhHK1Ey_t9x_B6JhJR0F4j_jgQH2zg9AWZkqd5aS6F4-r8QLKEhAYmjqbBGkBWWx1X898oNnCGhQssdZyC_7aFdPmkPGZMu65Evwq5Q","reviews":[{"author_name":"brian lewis","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115570504778712339244/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tuCQWCBi4OU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT5SxUuB1dCYOjifOq7zKrlq6JrcjQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Great deals on anything you need for riding bikes!

We went in to look at 5010's and the sales person we had was incredibly unhelpful. Not only did it seem like a burden for him to be working with us, he pointed us towards an Intense mountain bike that apparently is \"identical\" to the Santa Cruz 5010, yet couldn't elaborate on anything regarding either bike. In addition to him not being knowledgeable or articulate (we'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say maybe he's new), our sales person wasn't even excited... He wasn't excited about cycling as a whole or the $5,000+ we were willing to drop on a bike at his shop. We ended up leaving because it was not a positive experience and went to Art's Cyclery, which is top notch. My sister bought her last high end road bike from them and the sales people are genuinely excited about the product they sell and getting people riding... A pretty dramatic change from CBO.\n\nUnfortunately, Arts doesn't do rentals, so we ended up back at CBO... Yikes. My sister took out the Julianna and I took out a Santa Cruz Hightower LT. The Hightower was spec'd with SRAM Eagle, which would've been phenomenal, except that bike felt like it had never been maintained in its life. The shifting barely worked, the braking squealed like there were tiny hamsters caught in the calipers, and the dropper seat post wouldn't actually drop. Its a pretty disappointing experience to pay $160 for two high end, incredibly cool bikes and to go ride only to find out that no one at CBO cares enough to service them. The only thing the sales person said when we bought the bikes back was \"its a popular bike,\" which begs the question why maintaining it is so challenging...\n\nUltimately, CBO was a pretty disappointing experience in its entirety and there's no way we will buy any bikes from them.  0/10 would not recommend.","time":1514081555},{"author_name":"Pat Dempsey","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115160215503973939968/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iiT54DsksrE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABmA/Ac7_X5hqRSI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"9 months ago","text":"Very pleased with my treatment and the price of the bike.
