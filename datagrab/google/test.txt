Annie is what I would call a naturopathic massage therapist. She uses all natural essential oils, some of which are very expensive, and tries to focus on which oils will be best for you, as an individual. If you enjoy all the smells of Massage, you're going to love her. The massage I had was relaxing and she was very professional throughout. She has more than 20 years of experience. For those of you who are interested in a massage therapist's pressure or style when reading a review: I was really surprised that I feel just as good as, if not better than, when I get a sports massage style masseuse. I didn't know a massage didn't have to hurt you in order to make you feel relief from knots and tightness. Went to see her because I was having severe cervical neck pain. I don't really buy into the whole fufu hippie 'oils will heal your body' thing--because science--but I do believe in the physiological evidence for massage and Annie has a gift for it. I'm not sore at all and I barely felt discomfort while she was working out knots (honestly, I didn't think she applied enough pressure, but maybe it was the muscle relaxing oil because, wow. ). She wrapped up my massage with a lymphatic drainage. I'm in a lot less pain today than I've been in a month and I'm finally starting to feel more like myself again. Thank you, Annie! Oh, and her rates are very reasonable. I can't afford most massage therapists, but I can afford Annie. I did a 90-minute.","time":1490971769},{"author_name":"K. A.

The location is very easy to find and It's a nice short walk from the main street. They received us with two glasses of Kambucha tea to start detoxing, delicious! The apartment is really spacious and clean and they really care about maintaining a chemical free environment which we really appreciate. The BED is just amazing, we had never heard of an Orgone bed before and we were really excited to try it, it is made of Amethyst crystals and it's warm, comfy, and an experience on itself. Overall we had a wonderful stay. Thank you guys for everything.

I have been to both locations, and all stylists (I've had 3) are professional, nice, and very skilled. They fixed my hair after a botched home dye job and gave me the exact color I wanted (I literally pointed to a girl on the street and they matched the color!). They also know how to cut curly hair (which anyone with curly hair knows how hard it is to find a stylist that can do this!). I would recommend this salon to anyone and everyone. Plus, I think their prices are very fair. They also use Aveda products, which are naturally derived- cool, right?!

They really care about you and your pet. From the time you walk into the door to even days afterwards, they follow up. I’ve never had a veterinarian clinic who even share one-half to the Nth degree information about the happenings with my precious pet whether Having a routine visit,  teeth cleaning or surgery.  But here at Mission, this is Standard Operating Procedures.  Because I love this place too, all of my needed pet vaccinations are free. \n\nLet me share this with you!   Recently, one of my babies (a rescue) was involved in a tiff at home, over food of all things, which ended in a broken bone. Dr. Kevin was immediately onboard, even on his day off!  I’m not kidding. He came in with his comfortable t-shirt and shorts to splint her leg until surgery could be performed in the next couple of days. After surgery, my dog was rarely uncomfortable! This speak volumes regarding the quality of surgery she received. Included in my surgery we’re 10 sessions of laser treatments to speed up and increase the quality of her healing. If you’ve ever researched the price of laser....  Ten treatments included in the price of my surgery. WOW! And his staff are knowledgeable and sweet.  You don’t see a turn-over here either.  I’m getting to know all of them well now! Two weeks post surgery, except for her stitches and “Cone of Shame,” you wouldn’t know mentally or emotionally that this dog had a major surgery.  Serious. She’s ready to conquer the world again, this time leaving Lucy’s food alone.\n\nIn a nutshell, if you care about your pet and the quality of care he/she receives, I highly recommend Mission Animal Hospital for all of your needs.  You’ll find them right next to Trader Joe’s.  I’ve been an extremely happy customer since just after they opened.  I became a customer when one client of mine after another kept raving about this place. My turn to rave!  Come check this place out!  You won’t be disappointed.","time":1511704956},{"author_name":"Regis Weber","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106048301758899718039/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rJG38yir8oE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABYk/EvIQ3s2gsmQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"11 months ago","text":"First time here today and this was the best experience I've ever had at a veterinarian.

They have taken excellent care of our aging dogs (currently 14, 14, and 12 years old).  \n\nOur beagle has had a weeping tumor removed from behind his ear several times in the past, and I have had other vets tell me it is no longer operable.  Due to his age, I didn't really want to put him through another surgery anyway.  One of the vets at Mission Animal Hospital recommended a holistic approach and we started him on Transcend (a dietary supplement).  After a few weeks of him taking it, I noticed the tumor started to shrink and was not as weepy.  We are now on our second bottle, and although the tumor is still there, it is much more manageable, and is about 1/3 the size it was when he started taking the supplement.\n\nI appreciate the thoroughness of the evaluations and the open-minded approach I feel the vets have taken with my dogs.  I like that they offer holistic options alongside modern medical procedures.  It's like the best of both worlds!

Dr. Hassan provided my new pup with treats as she continued with her work and answered all of my questions. It was very refreshing to hear her share a lot of the same mentalities I have on responsibilities of pet ownership and when there is an opportunity to save a few extra dollars without negatively impacting your pet's health. After finishing taking care of my pup Dr. Hassan gave me a tour of the facility and spoke about her capabilities as well as her inabilities/limitations which I appreciated very much. It shows a lot of trust between doctor and client as well as a sense of pride by the owner in her practice.

Well, the SLOPD was going to have it towed. I hadn't realized that the car had been ticketed for being on the street for too long. I begged them not to tow the car, that I would make sure to handle it soon. The police said it was up to the tow truck guy who had already opened the hood (which was great because someone had backed into the car and not told me and I couldn't get the hood open to jump the car) and was almost ready to put it on the truck. The tow truck driver (handsome kid!) called his boss and they took pity on my tragedy and did not tow my late mothers car. They could have been jerks and taken the car since they had already used time and resources but they showed me compassion and I value that in a company. I would recommend them to anyone and will use their services whenever possible.","time":1429141005},{"author_name":"Cody

Every charter bus in Los Angeles were sold out of the weekend of April 24,25,26. I was really struggling to find a charter bus from Los Angeles to Las Vegas roundtrip. I was so upset I thought i wasnt going to have a trip anymore. My sister recommended me Silverado Stages because her University used them a ton. I went ahead and gave them a call and I was transferred to Lauri Seitz. From the begining Lauri went above and beyond to help me plan my trip to Las Vegas. She mapped out everything for me for a great price. She emailed me all the paper work that i signed and returned to her and set my trip up in 1 day flat. Now lets talk about the bus i got. I swear the bus looked brand spanking new. I felt like i was on a Virgin America Plane. 47 passanger bus with restroom, Blizzard cold AC, Reclining seats, 2 power outlet in front of your seats, Large monitors for DVD's and awesome sound system for your music. I was so beyond impressed. All my family and friends loved the bus I swear it was like a Mercedes bus. My Bus Driver Ahmad Thompson a nice sweet driver. He put all our luggage in the storage units below the bus and drove us to Vegas. He was wonderful i will request him on my next trip. I cannot stop thanking Lauri and Ahmad for making my trip happen. I was very scared at first to book them but at the end of my trip i felt like they are family friends to me.","time":1468265995},{"author_name":"Lady of the Lighted Path","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116615911534153122775/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-irmImLPaXbI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT7pYMw1bfP1lE1hvGH-lhVZxbH_Pg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"I have been calling for several days now, with no response in regards to a refund for my ticket.

It's very quiet and close to campus which is a big plus. The laundry rooms, however, could be better. It's very humid and crowded in there, with very little space to move around in order to take care of clothing. Most of the machines have mold in them, which is a health hazard to all tenants who use the machines. I've visited to laundry sites and they all have the same issues. The mold issue is a problem because the users close the door right after washing (allowing the hot water to cause bacteria to grow). If maintenance could perhaps clean the washers often, that would be great. Dryers are fine since they are hot and dry (evidently) which prevent bacterial growth. Other than that, Mustang is great for the price and location. The pools are well maintained, the study room is great, and I can't appreciate how quiet it is where I am (in the back near the stadium).","time":1511548172},{"author_name":"Katherine Thomas","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108858949241217838091/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5vSpDGTUCow/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA3A/4XvRSiGC4k8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"They are always trying to over charge me and I have to fight with them every time to get my money back.

Right when we returned from winter break, we came home to find our apartment flooded. They came and mopped it, but did nothing to prevent the issue from happening again. The second time it flooded they mopped once more and started talking about what they could do to solve it, but did nothing until the third time it flooded which was the worst time. Our entire apartment was covered with at least an inch of water. Don't get me wrong, the maintenance people are really nice and try their best to solve the issues, but it was obviously a task that should be handled by a professional. We got put up in a hotel for two nights, while they dried out our apartment and put new floors in. In typical Mustang Village fashion, they laid new floor over the old floor. Us being college students with no construction background at all could tell you that wasn't going to work, because the old flooring was cheap and absolutely soaked through. The flooding problem was eventually fixed, but a few days later we found mold all along our wall. Again, they didn't bring in professionals but just had their maintenance team try to handle the task.They knocked down the wall and put a new one up. Unsurprisingly, the mold came back. They were about to just knock down the wall again when we called in a city health inspector, who finally got them to listen, and they finally brought in professional. As you must do with mold, they blocked off much of our lower portion of our apartment to dry out the walls, which finally solved the problem. The professionals also found out about the flooring and thought it was ridiculous that they had just installed the new floors over the old floors. \nRandom funny anecdote, the health inspector taped a notice on our door that they had to deal with the mold issue and the manager GAVE US A VANDALISM CITATION!!!\n\nAnyway, the manager Justin Epperly is a complete asshole, who will not try to work with you to solve issues, and will lie to you about how much money he will give you so that you can stay in a hotel while they try to fix the issue for the umpteenth time. \nIf you don't have to deal with management or any major construction issues, maybe you'll be fine. I don't know, but I sure as hell would advise you not to come near Mustang Village.","time":1506826219},{"author_name":"Alex Kolarczyk","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108387531336917275254/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uQiUq3lxhLk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT6Mik9XT08V4VCCuFE8b6kHmYwgWw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"This place is literally the worst.

In addition to small scratches and dings around the unit, here were the most major problems that all existed before we arrived:\n- Broken dishwasher.\n- AC broken, and upon repair was noisy as it sprayed dust and rocks out the window.\n- 20ft deep clog in toilet (we found out this was the problem after maintenance snaked it).\n- Refrigerator covered in small dents on front, with back grate broken and wires spilling out. One day it turned off and we had to fiddle with the wires to get it working again.\n- Our unit was the only Townhome with carpeting downstairs, and it appeared to be covering an odd lump under the floor. There was a small nail protruding from beneath the edge of the carpet just far enough to poke a foot and snag on socks. This also made cleaning a lot harder because we planned for a hardwood floor with a non-carpet vacuum.\n- Lots of dust beneath all of the beds, as if the cleaning crew had barely slept over there surface and just ignored all of the places that were hard to reach. \n- One of the bulbs in the kitchen was burned out, making our apartment very dim, especially in combination with the dark carpet.\n- There were holes torn in the backs of both couches.\n\nBecause more things seemed to be broken than in good condition upon move-in, I have a very low opinion of Mustang. In addition, there have been incidents where they accidentally billed for an extra month that affected several renters. I do not look forward to move out, because I would not be surprised if they try to charge me claiming I broke all of the aforementioned appliances. Other people were less unlucky than us, but be aware that it can be as bad as our experience.","time":1513719442}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["university","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=12251848197600472248","utc_offset":-480,"vicinity":"1

I asked, \"How much could we be looking at?\" answered my question by repeating her question again. I gave a figure and stated that this was inappropriate timing for this conversation. I felt at the time if I had said $500, fees would be $500; if I had said $700, fees would be $700.\n\nDr. Examined the kitten, diagnosis was that kitten had a bite infection. Course of action would be an antibiotic injection with subcutaneous fluid. Afterwards the Dr. said if he is not getting better in 36 hours to call him right away. He did not get better; we called to arrange a follow up. The Drs. RVT \"Erin\" told us that the Dr. would not see our kitten until our balance was paid. She was rude to my wife and to me. Anytime we tried to ask a question she would interrupt and talk over us. My wife and I tried to have a rational conversation with this woman, however she just would not allow that to be. We asked to speak to the Dr. that was not an option; we inquired if she was the office manager, she replied “one of them.” I asked, “Is this direction of the Dr.” she replied, “Yes”. I felt I was lied to and that I wouldn’t be able to talk to the Dr. We ended the phone call with her promise to return our call. She never did. Erin's focus was on money, not the fact that our kitten may be ill, in pain or even die. \n\nOver the last 30 days we had paid 100% of costs to vaccinate two animals, neuter one with a follow up visit. We had put aside the funds to spay our female kitten in just a couple days and even had an appointment scheduled, over $500 in fees. Including an additional $10 toward the outstanding balance.\n\nTrue we had an outstanding balance of $280 from previous animal care the Dr. had provided. We had been making monthly payments. Due to unemployment, I hadn't made a payment in several months. However I had full intentions too do so. His front office staff was aware of this and told us that a $10 to $20 a month payment would be fine, it wouldn't be a problem. We inquired about this in advance and made sure before scheduling any new appointments.\n\nSubsequently went to a different vet. They were kind, compassionate & caring. Conducted blood test there at their facility and determined the issue. They gave him intravenous antibiotics and sent us home with an oral antibiotic. It’s been 12 hours and he has returned to almost normal.","time":1378164666},{"author_name":"Trevon Simmons","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106328985454237006848/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vhwOr5K6gDQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/N4J3bpl4Wu4/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"4 years ago","text":"Stenner Creek Animal Hospital is very dishonest and cares only about the amount of money they can suck out of people.\n\nCharging ridiculous rates for unnecessary procedures, these people are scam artist.\n\nBeware! \n\n","time":1366420719}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["veterinary_care","health","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=5376827188236116885","utc_offset":-480,"vicinity":"191 Santa Rosa Street, San Luis Obispo","website":"http://www.stennercreekanimalhospital.com/","html_attributions":[]},{"address_components":[{"long_name":"Dexter Road","short_name":"Dexter Rd","types":["route"]},{"long_name":"San Luis Obispo","short_name":"San Luis Obispo","types":["locality","political"]},{"long_name":"San Luis Obispo County","short_name":"San Luis Obispo County","types":["administrative_area_level_2","political"]},{"long_name":"California","short_name":"CA","types":["administrative_area_level_1","political"]},{"long_name":"United States","short_name":"US","types":["country","political"]},{"long_name":"93407","short_name":"93407","types":["postal_code"]}],"adr_address":"<span class=\"street-address\">Dexter Rd</span>, <span class=\"locality\">San Luis Obispo</span>, <span class=\"region\">CA</span> <span class=\"postal-code\">93407</span>, <span class=\"country-name\">USA</span>","formatted_address":"Dexter Rd, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407, USA","geometry":{"location":{"lat":35.3020952,"lng":-120.66538079999998},"viewport":{"south":35.3007219197085,"west":-120.66632833029149,"north":35.30341988029149,"east":-120.66363036970847}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/school-71.png","id":"d061fd0296199be1365b6a67fe325dbaa2aca65b","name":"PROVE Lab -

recognizable brands and campus brands, offering both healthy selection such as a full salad bar and indulgence selection like burgers and burritos. \n\nPricing is towards the high end, especially considering most identical menus just off campus are easily 15-25% cheaper. Service speed could use improvemt but considering the number of students it must serve daily and the mainly student based work force, it gets a pass.\n\nI don't see much faculty dining here, which can be a telltale for the overall sentiment towards dining hall. \n\nFood quality is decent overall, slightly above fast food quality, but not quite at a food truck level yet. There is a reasonable change in menu selection from year to year, with the essentials such as salads, sandwiches, and hamburgers remaining more or less the same.","time":1506284776},{"author_name":"jiwon kim","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108093323869654981105/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BaVZKDQLb_A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT7XiwSYtwN1plIUCmy8wxF_VRyJ1Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"Never left a negative review in my life but both the quality and the food itself is bad.

From complex surgery to very difficult to diagnose internal medicine cases she has been correct with her diagnosis every single time. For the past 14 years Doc has cared for my 2 German Shepherds and 1 Belgian Shepherd. The Germans had surgery and hip issues that were cared for with knowledge and Skill, the Belgian had a VERY rare pancreatic disorder that NO other vet could even come close to diagnosing correctly. The Belgian has been on treatment successfully for 7 years and we both owe our quality of life and health to Doctor O'Connor. Pope Francis should make a stop in SLO the next time he us in US, because Doc is a true Saint!! Thank you Doc., David L.

I hate to leave a bad review, as the staff seems nice and all, but come on! Every time we have been here we have waited well beyond our scheduled time. I'm talking 30+ minutes! I know you can get behind sometimes, but three appointments in a row?!? Unacceptable. We will not be going here any longer. \n\nUpdate: We now go to the Animal Care Clinic just off of Tank Farm Rd, and love it.","time":1355430787},{"author_name":"Amber Ortiz","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111626608292634364465/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xchdbthy6Lg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT4VHqIn_-O-IkQRL7ug7JgvtWOuyg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Worst Vet ever. Had 5 pets over the years we have taken to O'connor and every single problem any of our pets had they made us leave the pet over night (ALWAYS) the next day they come back absolutely filthy and they always say the same thing. For instance we had a pet with a bad food allergy and they never figured it out they kept saying that the skin rash was a ear infection. The pets are always starving when they get home on top of being absolutely (filthy from one night) we are never aloud to be there when they do the examination and they give you the same medication time after time for any problem. Took our pet to a new vet to see if they could find the problem causing the skin rash and they found it with in a few hours, after years of taking her to O'connor the new vet found and fixed the problem same day. I would never trust them with any animal ever. They are horrible.
