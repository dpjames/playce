Our arrival was scheduled for after 1AM and we had a rental car reserved, expecting to wait it out until the rental counter was open. We were not only informed that we could not wait for our car, but very rudely treated by the staff. Needless to say, having flown 6 hours to get here we were unfamiliar with the area and forced to bide our time in the local Denny's since it was all that we could find still open at that time. When I asked the employee when the airport would re-open, he hesitated. As I pressed for an answer he informed me it would open at 4AM, but that we would not be allowed to wait there. We returned at 4 and quietly waited at the rental counter and, amazingly, had no ill effects on the staff, building, or fellow travelers. He also curtly informed me that the Avis employee waited on ME until midnight. This is offensive in that their scheduled and posted hours are until midnight, so this individual was waiting for their shift to end, not on me. Additionally, our flight arrived after 1AM so I did not miss them out of negligence as he suggested, but because they had left a full hour or more before I set foot in the door. My issues are 1) this has never happened to me or anyone I've known through countless trips involving a multitude of airports and 2) if the airport does indeed close at a certain time (in this case 12:30), so be it, but then do not schedule flights arriving past that time. This was not due to a delay, this was a scheduled arrival. 3) this staff member was curt, rude, and insensitive. No other airport would kick travelers out rather than letting them sit quietly in a chair and wait. Needless to say we will avoid this airport at all cost in the future.","time":1507820238}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["airport","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=17619960603534638034","utc_offset":-480,"vicinity":"975

They have house made almond milk that was mind blowing. I asked for a small sample of it.. It was far superior to any store bought almond milk. You could actually taste real almond, and it had an almond powderyness that was amazing. The shop inside is really nice and modern. It's spacious and open.

If you can't afford to stay there or dine in their main restaurant, I recommended giving yourself a nice self guided tour of the place and eat at their coffee shop!\n\nThe staff is wonderful and welcoming. Exploring the venue is encouraged! Look at the bright pink main restaurant, bars, dance floor, fireplace, gift shop and don't forget the basement restrooms (a must, trust me)!!!\n\nThe coffee shop is like diner food. The food is average and it's pricey for what it is for sure... but it's worth it to sit down and enjoy the scenery. There is a book about the place they sell for $50 but you can bring the restaurant's copy to your table and check it out while you dine. It's super cool. The food is a 3, but the grounds are a 5+, which is why only 4 stars since this review is supposed to just be for the restaurant. \n\nA MUST see!!!\n","time":1503384976},{"author_name":"stephanie Dishen","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109364073154608893294/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FmXr_3FBO4Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/YyX3t12xynY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"My husband and I stopped here for a quick bite in between lunch and dinner. We both ordered salads, I ordered a half veggie sandwich. It took over an hour to get our food. And once we did finally get our orders, the bottom slice of my bread was so soggy it fell apart when I picked it up. The server was very nice when I asked her for a new piece of bread. Then to top it off, there was a hard stem from an avocado in the sandwich that I could have cracked a tooth on if I had bitten it. Luckily I didn't, and I just felt it in my mouth.  The service has been consistently slow every time we have come for dinner in the past year as well. I think we are done with madonna. The novelty isn't worth the poor service from the kitchen.

When I'd go in and make my payments I would make my whole payment but they werent telling me that half of my payment was going to a fee so now I have 4 months of incomplete payments on my credit. Also for a few months straight I'd come in to make a payment and they would keep telling me my address was incorrect so when I finally asked to speak to the manager she wasn't very friendly or apologetic about the fact that i was unhappy that I had to keep doing the same thing multiple times and that it made my visit longer. Also they won't help me at the desk they make me use the pods. I once waited 10 minutes because I had the time and there was no line initially and finally when I was able to be helped they turned me away and told me that I am taking time away from their business accounts and card holders and it would make them wait longer so then I had to wait another 5 minutes at the pods. A few times I've had a few nice encounters with employees at the SLO location but now I will be going to the Paso location because they are beyond friendly and they don't have pods so I can actually talk face to face with a person which I like and is the whole reason I pay in person to begin

I thought I would visit your little town, having not done so in several years, but wanted to have some extra cash with me for any small purchases I might make. Your bank was the first I happened upon so I stopped to use your ATM. \n\nTransaction was normal... insert card, select amount, agree to pay the $3.00 fee - higher than average, but expected. The ATM gave me my $40.00, printed a receipt then shut down without returning my card. \n\nNeedless to say, I was a little upset considering I was hundreds of miles from home and a machine had just eaten the only card I carry. I went into the bank and stated that the ATM had shut down without returning my card. The young woman at one of the desks seemed uninterested, in fact amused at my concern. She told me to wait - for what, I don't know as there were no customers in the bank. When she had completed whatever task she was attending, she retrieved my card and instead of apologizing for causing me any distress, inconvenience or harm she told me that it was company policy to confiscate debit cards not issued by Founders that are used in the ATM and destroy them. WHAT? She went on to inform me that the ATM machine is only for bank customers and couldn't understand why it had given me my 40 bucks and charged me 3 dollars. But it was company policy to shred my card. She refused to give me back my credit card and continued to threaten me with shredding it. Needless to say, I was now very angry.\n\nWHY, why was I being treated like a criminal for using a banks ATM, paying its service fee - there was no sign on the machine telling me not to use it? After I raised holy hell, she called someone and got permission to bypass policy as long as I could prove who I was. I provided ID, got my card, signed some form and left... again, with no apology for what was now not just an inconvenience, but for being treated like I had done something wrong - like I was insignificant, I was nothing. She smirked as she returned my card, apparently enjoying my distress. She seemed to find the incident amusing from the beginning, so much so that at one point I even asked her what she found so funny about the situation and my concerns.\n\nI could not believe any of this was happening and all because I was simply using the ATM machine at Founders Bank. You're a publicly traded institution and this is how you treat people, these are your policies?\n\nMay I suggest you post a very large sign over your ATM machine that unless you are a customer of that bank you should not use your credit card or debit card for it will be confiscated, shredded and you will be treated like crap by employees of the bank.","time":1376664214},{"author_name":"Travis Storm","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109084095626185584600/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-x0HuoqrlRvM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADg4/_UQEKXO_Su0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"5 years ago","text":"I'm not a Founders customer; I parked in the Founders parking lot on South Higuera Street to go to Autozone, not knowing that the parking lot was reserved for Founders Community Bank.

I didn't know that breakfast service ended at 10:30am. It was pointed out to me by Morgan, where the notice is at the bottom of the menu in small letters. I said, \"Having that notice at the bottom is very misleading to customers and it's bad customer service.\" Morgan said, \"No, it's not. We're not an all-day breakfast place.\" Really, she should have shown some empathy instead, offering a solution to my breakfast dilemma by saying, \"I'm sorry, we stop serving breakfast at 10:30am, but here are some other choices for you.\" I became frustrated with her snippy attitude and flabbergasted I would be treated this way, but I was pretty hungry, so I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and an orange juice. She asked if I wanted my receipt, and I said, \"No,\" and then she VIOLENTLY grabbed the receipt from my hand and threw it away, then just stormed off and presumably complained about my behavior to her other coworkers. If I hadn't paid for my food, I would have asked to speak to her manager right then and there. NOBODY deserves to be treated this way, Morgan. I've been in customer service for over 25 years, and you ALWAYS treat your customers with RESPECT, even if you don't agree with them.

The restaurant wasn't too full so staffing was likely minmal. Food took a little while but nothing outlandish. We never got any coffee refills while eating or waiting. We ordered the Red Flannel Hash and it was pretty tasty. Everything was cooked nicely and was presented in a nice cast iron skillet. The unfortunate thing is the skillet was less than half full. The poached eggs were nicely done but the amount of hash that we got was to be honest a bit disappointing.

The person that opened my account in the first place is either not there, and another time, was too busy to help me deposit over $200,000.00 into an IRA account.  If I owned this bank I would fire personnel, and only hire people who are trained, experienced and care about customer service.","time":1500672902},{"author_name":"2ltJohn Leffler","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116075397138555057859/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MHzq4Ed49WQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEw/hgBJ6wobL8s/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"","time":1507067756},{"author_name":"westen meyer","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118223482674993062883/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1BsIPN9mOsw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE0/FvSRnSteBD4/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"","time":1505757042},{"author_name":"Michelle Sarabia","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114178639648606994224/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P0oRrC5KRHg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT5tZ9-_inxuICzLEaje3TsziGsOpw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"","time":1470724926}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["bank","atm","finance","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=17273217211401127234","utc_offset":-480,"vicinity":"75 Santa Rosa Street, San Luis Obispo","website":"http://www.rabobankamerica.com/","html_attributions":[]},{"address_components":[{"long_name":"331","short_name":"331","types":["street_number"]},{"long_name":"Pacific Street","short_name":"Pacific St","types":["route"]},{"long_name":"San Luis Obispo","short_name":"San Luis Obispo","types":["locality","political"]},{"long_name":"San Luis Obispo County","short_name":"San Luis Obispo County","types":["administrative_area_level_2","political"]},{"long_name":"California","short_name":"CA","types":["administrative_area_level_1","political"]},{"long_name":"United States","short_name":"US","types":["country","political"]},{"long_name":"93401","short_name":"93401","types":["postal_code"]}],"adr_address":"<span class=\"street-address\">331 Pacific St</span>, <span class=\"locality\">San Luis Obispo</span>, <span class=\"region\">CA</span> <span class=\"postal-code\">93401</span>, <span class=\"country-name\">USA</span>","formatted_address":"331 Pacific St, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401, USA","formatted_phone_number":"(805) 234-2302","geometry":{"location":{"lat":35.2742522,"lng":-120.6681418},"viewport":{"south":35.27295106970849,"west":-120.6695335802915,"north":35.27564903029149,"east":-120.66683561970848}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/generic_business-71.png","id":"f0b4b9b1291c9823c09b80a809d3a8ea8488670b","international_phone_number":"+1 805-234-2302","name":"Drew Davis Fine Art","photos":[{"height":612,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107372062914993317593/photos\">Drew Davis Fine Art</a>"],"width":612},{"height":726,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107372062914993317593/photos\">Drew Davis Fine Art</a>"],"width":726},{"height":320,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107372062914993317593/photos\">Drew Davis Fine Art</a>"],"width":320}],"place_id":"ChIJe861wuLw7IAR3gOMof1P5HQ","rating":5,"reference":"CmRRAAAA_LA-tLBLSYGweMBc4TbUGTteZorZ4m6pDsbgqb9Xd2muuToktBz1y_9FFZXQ2GzglTv4eN_esjzJqjJHqAOZQ7V4sKMYx-xXUK7jYrIpYAc0TNsABdecdVWvV7ukMuhkEhBeWzkwiLYItki22gVYJ8S-GhRuVgszX_vyazb2yEqfU3qrtDCNDw","reviews":[{"author_name":"Jennifer Luck","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110323066504476978012/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kUQXVrkIr9M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT59xJx9Lgf4Bx9EkV6aYdQIHy8xIA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"I love Drew's fun and bold style of painting.

We liked the Ashley Metcalf power recliner sofa we found in the Morro Bay store. We compared couch potato price to other local stores and internet stores and found it a bit higher.\nWe thought about it for a week or two and then went back to the store and asked if they would price match the the price in the other local store. We gave them a print out showing the other stores price.   Bill Smith, the store manager, was able to match the price saving us about $500.\nWe bought and paid for the couch and they said delivery would be approximately 2 to 4 weeks.  (Couch potato offers free delivery and setup).  We were surprised when Couch Potato called after a week and a half saying it was in.  \n\nThe delivery men brought the couch in and put it in position and assembled the backs to the couch base.\n\nThey plugged it in and It works perfectly.\n\nOne thing... Be sure you ask for the assembly and troubleshooting paperwork.... Since they did not offer to give the paperwork to us.  \n\nSince the couch is in the middle of the room we did not want cords leading to the couch. We bought the Lismoss mc-160 battery pack on Amazon.  Now we have no cords.... We just need to charge the battery every couple weeks.  I will need to buy a second battery or a Y cable since each recliner end is powered separately with its own power supply.","time":1508175056},{"author_name":"Sheryl Swanson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103239681103102376663/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-F8U6bQSp8lw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT5YtGzx1iqnGTZYNsI1IXsV_IG3CQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Fantastic store!

However, last week my husband and I stopped by and used another branch (because it was \"on our way\" basically it was out of convenience) to set up the all necessities  of us being out of the country. We wanted to inform the bank that we would be using our debit cards, out of the country; for the unforeseeable future. We had it set up with different times, my husband was going 1 week before me. He left two days ago and finally arrived 2.21.17.  We gave her the appropriate dates for each of us. The lady behind the teller desk  took all the pertinent information and informed us that we were all taken care of. There is a time difference of about 10 hours between here and there. Today was the first day my husband was there, so I woke up to a text from my husband telling me he is having difficulties and that he's receiving fraud alerts from the bank. Obviously, I called the bank that we primarily use and informed a wonderful, kind, helpful woman by the name of Kristen. After explaining the entire story she was able to rectify the situation in a matter of minutes. I can not ever begin to explain the amount of help she was to us. And I was ever so humbled by her saying, \"I'm just doing my job.\"  Really, because the other teller was supposed to be just doing her job. Which was by far so much more inferior to that of Kristen. She went above and beyond in my opinion, she made sure I had the banks phone number, the direct line, the back line, her email address, and her managers email address. I have all the information that I could possibly need to be able to get in contact with someone there, should any additional problems occur. Now that Kristen is on the team/case I have NO fears that anything other than a great time will be had by my husband and I due to the fact that we will no longer have to worry about issues we thought we had already addressed.They HAVE NOW BEEN DEALT WITH THANKS A MILLION TO KRISTEN !!!!!\nStay tuned because more on Kristen will be discussed. I will also be contacting her manager. \n\nWAY TO GO KRISTEN!!!!\n\"IM JUST DOING MY JOB!!!\nIf only we had more people like you.","time":1487803678},{"author_name":"franchesca

If I then think to myself, \"Oh nice, I have $50 in my checkings account, I'll by a burger for $10!\", my card will either be declined or I will have overdrawn by $10, resulting in a $30 dollar overdraft fee (which is also totally absurd). \n\nSecondly, just today I was using a Rabobank ATM with my Rabobank card, withdrawing cash. Or so I thought, because apparently a RABOBANK ATM DOESNT ACCEPT MY CARD'S BANK? Amazing. You can't make this stuff up. Not only that, but after several attempts, the ATM ate my card and said it needed to be \"retained\". No call from Rabobank before this occurred, and after 30 minutes of trying to call them and getting put on hold and transferred through robotically manned departments and not ONCE hearing a human voice, I gave up. These people are totally apathetic and incompetent.

We got there nice and early and sat in the waiting area while she was with other clients until 4:20. Then she gave us a sideways glance and without saying a word to us she told another client that she was ready to see her. I told her that we had an appointment at 4 and she just said can you come back in tomorrow? I asked what time and she said I could make an appointment at pretty much any time. So I asked why we should make an appointment if they don't mean anything and she said ok just come in whenever. So I asked what time her lunch hour was and she said she wouldn't know until the time comes. I am usually a very patient person but my family is going through a total crisis and we left my dad in the hospital just to make this appointment. The fact that she didn't even bother to say \"I'm sorry I'm running behind\" or \"it looks like we aren't going to be able to keep this appointment\" showed a complete disregard to their clients.

Their items are wonderful quality, so much so that the best item of clothing I ever owned was from there but sadly was stolen during a trip. I went to return to the shop again many times to see if they have similar items, but I have never been able to purchase anything because during normal working hours, the store is almost -always-closed. How do you expect to run a business this way? Is there some kind of problem? How can you pretend like your store is special and spiritually sound and all this when you don't even care about your customers? Is Hempshak trying to go out of business? As it stands, I think I would have better luck hitchhiking my way to New York with a giant gorilla, twenty-two tons of weoponry and a nuclear bomb.
