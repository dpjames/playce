It stared when trying to make the appointment. The body shop and I played phone tag for one whole day until I decided to come in the following to avoid further delaying making an appointment. Jeff told me to come in Monday (it was Wednesday) and give them 5 days, that way it wouldn’t go into the weekend. \n\nBring it in Monday, had not heard from him by Thursday so I called, 3 times, and the third time I waited until he just came to the phone. He admitted it would not be done Friday, maybe Monday. If I hadn’t called I would have never known. Don’t give a timeline if you cannot stick to it, and if you can’t stick to said timeline at least notify the guest about changes.\n\nIt is now Tuesday, I called this morning asking what the new eta was...\n\nUnhappy about lack of communication from this company and department. Like I said, I’m sure the job was done will but not timely and the fact that I had to ask all the follow up questions leaves everything to be desired in the service department.\n\nI would not use them again","time":1513104973},{"author_name":"Exphixius","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109379910438710731451/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DQBIVSZPDps/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT4HMC1qmu-TP87UxixeBAplWifX8A/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Ive had a few car purchase experiences in my life, this is by far the worst. I will say that I will not call out anyone by name, that is not what this is about, I will call out the business.\n\nThe car was being leased, originally acquired from out of state, and they were contacted several times to attempt to purchase the car at the end of the term. No return call for 5-6 weeks, and the car went over the deadline. They waived the additional fee and allowed the car to be purchased (Although they said they normally dont resale leased vehicles). I was annoyed, but grateful that they allowed the purchase. Then the real struggle began.\n\nThe car was dropped off for inspection and detailing before purchase. 2 days later I went in to finish the paperwork, and pick up the car as I was told it was in \"Perfect\" condition. The detail/cleaning of the car still wasnt complete. Also they asked that I bring the car back in 2 days later to have the tires replaced, as rotating them wasnt good enough. They would fix the chip in the windshield then and finish the detailing. Said it would take a couple of hours, by noon at the latest. No problem.\n\nI brought the car back the night before, the service department had no idea there was an appointment at all the next day, as it wasnt scheduled. They proceeded to schedule it on the spot and said they would take care of it first thing in the morning. Even had me park it in front of the door to make sure. Again annoyed, but not too bad. \n\nNoon the following day arrived and no call. I tried reaching out on the text \"app\" that was sent to me, no response. Tried calling the service desk, no return call. Talked to the individual i spoke with who financed my car, said he would reach out. I eventually got a call the following day informing me that my windshield would need to be replaced, that they couldnt fix the chip. I was confused but said ok.\n\nThe day after that I was told that the rear seatbelt wasnt working properly and would need to order that.\n\nThe next day I got a call saying the tires had never been ordered, and would have to wait on those. Ok? I thought an inspection of the car had been done? Why is a mandatory safety item overlooked, and is somehow caught when you are supposed to be replacing tires that you didnt order and a windshield that you werent?\n\nDuring this time 6 different people were passing information between myself and the other person on the loan. All with mixing stories, half answers, and \"I'll have to get back to you's\", but never actually getting back to me.... someone else would with further confusing information.\n\nAt the end of it all, the car was picked up, the detailing/cleaning had NOT been finished. The windshield had NOT been replaced and I was there staring at the same chip I had left the car with. Also, the tires they had replaced... low air pressure. The gas tank? Less than 1/2 gallon of gas in the car. The kicker? After filling the gas tank and tires that were left low, and starting the car what did I notice? The \"Inspection Due Now\" notification pops up on the display. I couldnt help but laugh. \n\nSo after having bought a car and waiting 12 days without it, Im not even sure what was actually done, besides waste my time. I was given the excuse there is a lot of problems in the service department, too many chiefs wearing too many hats. Well Im sorry, that is not my issue. Im paying for something, expecting a certain quality of service, get your act together for crying out loud.\n\nWhen I asked to speak to a service manager, I was told he would be calling me the following Monday. This review is made the Wednesday of the week I was supposed to have gotten a call. Did I get a call? If you guessed of course not, you are correct. I will be filing a complaint to VWoA. I will file a complaint to Perry. I will tell everyone I can, in any way I can the poor service that occurs there. \n\nThis was my first and last experience with Perry Volkswagen of San Luis Obispo.","time":1505338314},{"author_name":"Joe Duran","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106101764590248546804/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GlzO_6XYCuE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT6ZkPYWyP-L4OhCTfa-OgnM8xiKqA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"9 months ago","text":"Great experience shopping here!Drove up from Ventura to trade in my 13 tdi for a 15 tdi.

Honestly we didn't expect to like the cars as much as we did considering we had been expecting to probably buy a Volvo or Lincoln. It's a day that's been raining and we didn't particularly want to dirty up the cars on test drives but they said let's go. Took a look at 3 different models and ended up really liking two, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and how well they drove. We had been working with Joel and told him we were going to go grab lunch to talk and that's we'd be back either way. While at lunch we decided let's just get one and checked the website for other colors. Got back to the dealership and told Joel what we were thinking. He went and pulled the car up and we decided to get it. The buying process was quick easy and painless. It was great to agree on a price almost immediately and get the paperwork going.

Some of the things that attracted us to the church are the biblically sound teaching, the boldness to talk about current issues and how they relate to the truth found in the Bible, the focus on connecting and growing in small groups, the broad range of ages and life stages represented in the church, and the seemingly solid children's ministry for our two little girls.\n\nThe thing that has kept us going back to Grace is the relationships we've built with other members through women's bible study, men's book study, and our small group.\n\nThe lead pastor, Tim, seems very genuine.  He quickly reached out to my wife and I soon after we had visited, learned our names, and encouraged us every time he saw us pass through the courtyard after service.  He constantly reaches out to new visitors and encourages the other members to do the same.  Helen is an incredible leader in the children's class room.\n\nWe are happy to call Grace our church home.","time":1462337479}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["church","place_of_worship","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=2072091007889377204","utc_offset":-480,"vicinity":"1350 Osos Street, San Luis Obispo","website":"http://www.gracecentralcoast.org/","html_attributions":[]},{"address_components":[{"long_name":"1023","short_name":"1023","types":["street_number"]},{"long_name":"Marsh Street","short_name":"Marsh St","types":["route"]},{"long_name":"Downtown","short_name":"Downtown","types":["neighborhood","political"]},{"long_name":"San Luis Obispo","short_name":"San Luis Obispo","types":["locality","political"]},{"long_name":"San Luis Obispo County","short_name":"San Luis Obispo County","types":["administrative_area_level_2","political"]},{"long_name":"California","short_name":"CA","types":["administrative_area_level_1","political"]},{"long_name":"United States","short_name":"US","types":["country","political"]},{"long_name":"93401","short_name":"93401","types":["postal_code"]},{"long_name":"3629","short_name":"3629","types":["postal_code_suffix"]}],"adr_address":"<span class=\"street-address\">1023 Marsh St</span>, <span class=\"locality\">San Luis Obispo</span>, <span class=\"region\">CA</span> <span class=\"postal-code\">93401-3629</span>, <span class=\"country-name\">USA</span>","formatted_address":"1023 Marsh St, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401, USA","formatted_phone_number":"(805) 543-6943","geometry":{"location":{"lat":35.2804227,"lng":-120.65940810000001},"viewport":{"south":35.2791899697085,"west":-120.66086033029148,"north":35.2818879302915,"east":-120.65816236970852}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/generic_business-71.png","id":"741ceb7619e1a108c40942750e108bba72b694ad","international_phone_number":"+1 805-543-6943","name":"Sunset North Car Wash","opening_hours":{"open_now":true,"periods":[{"close":{"day":0,"time":"1600","hours":16,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516579200000},"open":{"day":0,"time":"0900","hours":9,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1517158800000}},{"close":{"day":1,"time":"1700","hours":17,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516669200000},"open":{"day":1,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516636800000}},{"close":{"day":2,"time":"1700","hours":17,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516755600000},"open":{"day":2,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516723200000}},{"close":{"day":3,"time":"1700","hours":17,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516842000000},"open":{"day":3,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516809600000}},{"close":{"day":4,"time":"1700","hours":17,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516928400000},"open":{"day":4,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516896000000}},{"close":{"day":5,"time":"1700","hours":17,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1517014800000},"open":{"day":5,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1516982400000}},{"close":{"day":6,"time":"1700","hours":17,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1517101200000},"open":{"day":6,"time":"0800","hours":8,"minutes":0,"nextDate":1517068800000}}],"weekday_text":["Monday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Tuesday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Wednesday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Thursday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Friday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Saturday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM","Sunday: 9:00 AM – 4:00 PM"]},"photos":[{"height":2988,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/110908282611294552496/photos\">Brenda Galvan</a>"],"width":5312},{"height":2988,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/110908282611294552496/photos\">Brenda Galvan</a>"],"width":5312},{"height":5344,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/115441001063539941892/photos\">Michael Berry</a>"],"width":3006},{"height":250,"html_attributions":["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/113206438809954145630/photos\">Sunset North Car Wash</a>"],"width":250}],"place_id":"ChIJOZPfYgTx7IARBs38qhzDo8E","rating":3.7,"reference":"CmRSAAAATMmTssEiYxVGjdbfyvss4ciXDAPz7cJfrBDOn9yQ9VGAsXFtm2maQrv6JYJ2VSKAwgM5fxROJ2C0lqd1eltJEOq8CoN6m6ybbqO5hNBY0wZR6QTGIDo1AfYz_UU3ypG0EhBrMNZ0oGA6WHXq8tC485lZGhQmwGCMmDBClj62VsPyYfoK7pSlAg","reviews":[{"author_name":"Steve Shurick","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110693984956787770507/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kzgHHAkt7ps/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT7bkosl1kDh6DuYW6n3od34rlDamQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"8 months ago","text":"New prices are a ripoff.

He then tricked one of them into showing him her fake id to give his personal opinion on it.. thinking the guy was nice the girl gave it to him and then said he was going to call the cops on her!

Ten minutes after the customer behind me left the counter, the agent comes strolling out while texting on her cell phone, despite the fact she knew I was late for a client meeting.

She says she'll send someone out to meet me and to call back when I reach my location. Long story short, the car ends up turning off and I'm stranded until 10pm.

All different brands have different styles and for the amount of money you pay, you should get the style you feel most comfortable in.\nThe manager went on to say that I also had the shirt steamed, which never happened (probably the salesmen lying to him), told me he would never sell a shirt, even if worn once in his store... Really?! I find that hard to believe.\nWhich pissed me off most! When I asked if they can tailor it to fit me!

The car was 14 yrs old with 282,000 miles and we would have junked it before spending any money on it. When I disputed the bill they insisted I sign a release for any and all liability on the repairs made on the car.  I would not sign it or pay for the repairs.  They seized the car and I lost my only transportation and it has caused horrible stress. They do not provide written estimates . They will call and suggest repairs and bill you thousands of dollars without a written estimate.  DO NOT GO HERE.

I rented a 2017 Cadillac CTS sedan from Enterprise.  The area where the cars were located was a complete mess.  They handed the keys from the office area and told me to find it in stall 18.  Cars were stacked in this parking lot and it took 3 guys jockeying cars so that I could pull out of the parking lot.  Clearly they were understaffed and rushing to check customers in and get customers out of the lot.  As I pulled out of the lot (finally), I noticed a warning light on in the car.  It said the right back tire had low pressure.  I stopped and got out of the car and checked the tire and visually, it was fine...it did not appear lower than the other tire and I just figured that they checked this stuff before they give a car to customers.  I continued on my way from SLO to Sacramento and on I-5 north, near Tracy, CA, the right tire blew as I was in the fast lane, going about 70mph.  I was swerving all over the road as I was trying to control the car while driving on the metal part of the tire.  I managed to get across all four lanes and park on the side of I-5 without hitting another car or semi-truck.  I'm still not sure how I survived...extremely blessed.  The Enterprise quality control procedures failed.  No one should have rented this car.  It should not have been on the lot.  I talked to the Regional Manager of this location and requested a copy of the checklist on this car.  I have not received anything or a call back on the results of his investigation and the request was made two weeks ago.  Needless to say, I rate this dangerous experience a 1 star.  If I could give a lesser rating, I would.","time":1510246720},{"author_name":"William Kneeland","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115926718972982901336/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gSSjNAfthU8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AA6ZPT7vSIW7gm9Z5moZUqw76fhoaASW9w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"I had a very good experience with this car rental.
