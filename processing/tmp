[I love this place for two reasons: 1. They have GREAT teas! You wont find any trashy Stash here. 2. They have GREAT music playing. You'll hear oldies, jazz, and and great world music at decent decibels (thank you for not giving into the club music at all hours trend so many other coffee shops have fallen into). PLUS Steynberg has a bright, open ambiance, great beagles, and rotating artwork! Definitely my favorite place to get work done, get inspired, or get together with friends.
5, Very relaxing and artistic atmosphere all around. Great teas and coffee, and plenty of treats if you need a small bite to eat.They seem to not want students studying here with computers, as seen in the lack of outlets, and their tables are a bit small, so it only works as a study spot for one person anyways. If you're looking for a study spot, you might want to go somewhere else. If you want to relax and talk about the arts, this is the perfect place to go.
5, This gallery and coffee shop is a leading independent place in San Luis. They sponsor art in so many forms and display it and encourage it and are part of the art community. That said let us turn to the coffee. Great coffee and always friendly we stopped there often
5, Excellent espresso drinks, chai tea and muffins.  Lovely mix of cafe, art gallery and small performing arts venue, with a stage and a bar.
5, Great coffee, beautiful gallery. A really nice place to go in the mornings.

[Great place to browse and discover new, creative things, especially if you're shopping for gifts or really anything outside the ordinary department store experience. 
5, Hands Gallery is a must stop when we have out of town guests. The breadth of their art and the quality of the pieces make this a favorite stop. The selection is quite eclectic, and to some degree defies description. If you are looking for an odd set sof salt and pepper shakers, or an incredible engraved dinner table, or hundreds of items in between, there seems to be something for everyone here! Go Often, increase art collection and enjoy life!

4, Had a delicious oat scone and a hot chocolate,  both were great and the service was wonderful!
5, Great Chai latte, cold or hot. This place has been here for a long time with a name change or two under its belt. It's a nice reprieve from the kreuzberg, or Starbuck busy body places elsewhere in downtown SLO.
5, Very GOOD COFFEE! Yummi food choices! And parking isnt too bad either. Girls were very sweet and Good attitude with Custmers💖

[Instantaneously fell in love. If I would live in this city I would be here all the time. Open space yet you can find some privacy, there's a community space with no laptop allowed with wood chess boards, flowers, and board games/books. No loud up-beat music. This afternoon it was Amelie Poulain soundtrack, it was great and soft. To drink, I had Jasmin Tea with a hint of house-made vanilla syrup and house-made almond milk. It was great. Their Ice Latte is legit. Enjoy your stay there!
5, Out of all the hip new coffee shops in SLO, this one is my favorite for a simple cup of classically roasted joe... or java... or whatever else they got now. Totally worth the trek. Great revolving artwork that displays the diversity of artistic talent amongst the locals, and the barista’s don’t leave... so you know the return customers treat them well.
5, This place hit the trifecta for me - great ambiance, friendly staff, and really good coffee. Plus, the music added to the relaxed vibe. I also grabbed a couple of pastries, which were really good, as well.
5, Easily the best coffeeshop in a long time. We got the brown sugar latte with extra espresso shot and almond milk. The drink was one of the best espresso drinks Ive had in a very long time. I was shocked. They have house made almond milk that was mind blowing. I asked for a small sample of it.. It was far superior to any store bought almond milk. You could actually taste real almond, and it had an almond powderyness that was amazing. The shop inside is really nice and modern. It's spacious and open. They have board games to play and chess tables with fancy pieces already setup. They have a no laptop section so people can socialize, which we thought was cool. Overall, I'd definitely stop here again next time in SLO.
5, Quaint yet trendy. Ascendo coffee embodies everything people need in a quiet coffee shop for conversation and fellowship. The baristas are kind and considerate. Their latte art is second to none👌👌👌 The venue is warm, well-lit and open. And if that isn't enough to convince you this should be your next stop for your SLO-calized coffee experience then I'll even go so far as tell you this... If the joy of life is a cup, Ascendo is where I go for refills

[The Madonna is a MUST see location. If you can't afford to stay there or dine in their main restaurant, I recommended giving yourself a nice self guided tour of the place and eat at their coffee shop!The staff is wonderful and welcoming. Exploring the venue is encouraged! Look at the bright pink main restaurant, bars, dance floor, fireplace, gift shop and don't forget the basement restrooms (a must, trust me)!!!The coffee shop is like diner food. The food is average and it's pricey for what it is for sure... but it's worth it to sit down and enjoy the scenery. There is a book about the place they sell for $50 but you can bring the restaurant's copy to your table and check it out while you dine. It's super cool. The food is a 3, but the grounds are a 5+, which is why only 4 stars since this review is supposed to just be for the restaurant. A MUST see!!!
4, My husband and I stopped here for a quick bite in between lunch and dinner. We both ordered salads, I ordered a half veggie sandwich. It took over an hour to get our food. And once we did finally get our orders, the bottom slice of my bread was so soggy it fell apart when I picked it up. The server was very nice when I asked her for a new piece of bread. Then to top it off, there was a hard stem from an avocado in the sandwich that I could have cracked a tooth on if I had bitten it. Luckily I didn't, and I just felt it in my mouth.  The service has been consistently slow every time we have come for dinner in the past year as well. I think we are done with madonna. The novelty isn't worth the poor service from the kitchen. 
1, If you're coming here for the food, the best thing is the cake. The lattes and hot cocoas both come from a machine and taste very watered down. The vanilla latte tasted like water with milk in it. The waitress said all danishs were special order. (Not sure what that means) so we were unable to order any. If you want to eat in the cafe it seems the only good food is the cake, nothing else is worth the cost (very expensive for the quality). I would only reccomend visiting to see the building itself not for the food.
1, Great food, the waitress was very helpful and the hostess (the younger ( was great
5, Love the inn and go at least 4 times a month. Service needs to be improved as lately it's been less friendly and accommodating (that's why I took a star off my rating).

5, Everything was great. Had a latte and a panini, so I can say the food is as good as the coffee.
5, Good coffee, but food items are a bit pricey
4, Everything was great. Great coffee, Great pastries and great and cheerful people at the shop.
5, The food & beverage service/quality is on par with all the Blackhorse Coffee Shops in SLO. However, there are only 5 spaces for parking so if your not coming in foot you'll have to park and walk over. This location has covered outdoor seating which I really love on a rare rainy SLO day.

[Go early for best selection. Don't miss the day old rack for bargains. Some samples are fresh from the oven and still warm.
5, Ironically, the bread itself isn't really the star of the show here. It's not bad, but it's all a bit samey. The pastries, sandwiches, and breakfast baguettes are the real reasons to come in. The Baguettes sell out pretty early in the morning most mornings, but the pastries are there all morning and they're fantastic. For lunch, the club on Garden Herb bread is primo.
4, The quality is just fantastic. We have been getting bread here for years and it is so much better than grocery store bread. Our favorite is the raspberry swirl bread (makes great toast). We also love the cinnamon swirl bread for french toast, the garden herb for sandwiches, the oatmeal applesauce for peanut butter sandwiches, the jalapeno jack for grilled chicken sandwiches. The croissants are the best around and the cranberry bran muffins are tasty and unique. They offer samples too! I love trying new stuff while I pick up our regulars. 
5, This is a great neighborhood bakery ! We were on vacation from Palm Springs and I was craving some baked goods. I walked in and was quickly offered a sample of fresh sourdough bread. The lady behind the counter sliced off a huge , thick piece of bread and offered me some butter ! It was delicious ! I'm hooked ! We purchased a couple of loaves and we were on our way.
5, Good pastries and breads. Fresh and samples

[After a flood in our home which required the removal of the existing fireplace, office flooring and baseboard, I contacted Matt Clark Tile for help designing the new fireplace and ultimately installing the beautiful custom tile I selected from their showroom.  Working with Matt Clark was a smooth and professional process.  The installation of the tile was an amazing process to watch.  The work area was well protected and left clean after each day of work.  The personal attention from Matt Clark, his staff and tile installers is something you will not get from the big box stores.  If you have a tile project, take the time to visit Matt Clark Tile.
5, Great selection and friendly service. They really helped me with my bathroom tile for two home locations. Katie was really professional and easy to work with. I can't wait for my next renovation project so I can work with them again!
5, Huge collection with top quality products, friendly and helpful staff. The product specialist Anna is absolutely fabulous! Would  definitely recommend stopping by.
5, Went into the store because, strangely enough, Matt Clark is also my name. Glad I did. Incredible selection of tile. Matt did a great job on the installation. Very helpful staff to work with.
5, Beautiful tile....tile from Spain, England and hand made in America! It’s a tile candy store! We had a vision for our bathrooms and they made it happen with helpful suggestions! Can’t wait to do the kitchen with them..!!!!

[Well worth visiting!  Super fresh donuts as it's popular with the locals and college students. Only a little pricer than average donut shops,  but well worth it with all the custom varieties. Board games and lots of seating available. Kept me and my kids entertained for a one hour total visit.
5, Great vibe. Very chill. Fun donut choices. Only reason not a 5star is they were out of couple donuts I liked. However, the new one I tried was good too
4, This is strictly for the GF/Vegan option! I can only speak for the gluten-free vegan donut, but it tasted like chemicals and bad, with an awful texture. I appreciate that they HAVE GF donuts (and vegan ones too!) hence the second star... but, I pretty much spat my first bite out and didn't finish it. That said, they have an amazing collection and the space was cool.
2, Used to be a loyal sunshine fan but have seen the light, it's got a college atmosphere if you are into but if not the doughnut is worth it anyway.
4, Most definitely the best donut shop! I got their Strawberry 🍰 cake donut and hot apple cider. Super good!

5, Joe and Susie are the best! They have such an artist's touch with their framing. Top notch quality, attention to detail, mat work, and they also have the coolest frames to choose from. I don't even try to pick out what will go best with the piece of art because they know their stuff so well--I just tell them do what you think is best and every single time they deliver my art my mind is blown. I would never hire anyone else for framing!

[More expensive than most coffee joints, but it makes up for it with a large selection of pastries and sandwiches, ample parking, and a lack of crowds which plagues many of the other SLO coffee shops (especially during midterms and finals weeks).
4, Friendly staff, plenty of seating. Delish
5, Strangely bright for a coffee shop, definitely feels like you're in a cheap strip mall. High rating for staff and drink/food quality.
4, The Establishment itself is nice and clean with a good atmosphere but I find what they serve to be very underwhelming especially for the price point
2, Nice coffee place.  I'll be back.

[Loved the cookie cup! I got the peanut butter one, and it was awesome!!
5, Their holiday flavors are AMAZING! Chocolate preppermint is my favorite!!!
5, Cookies are a tad hard to eat as a sandwich with softer ice cream between them. Maybe underbaking the cookies, that's how I like them anyway, might help a little? Obviously I don't know but the ice cream went everywhere when you tried to take a bite. Great flavors though!
4, Website says open to 9:00pm... employee closed up at 8:20 and said he was closed for the night?!?! What? Go to a real ice cream shop like Doc Burnsteins
1, Pumpkin Ice cream and snicker doodle cookie cups are delicious!!!

[The only place within hundreds of miles that makes & sells Bagels7 days a week & is open till about 9 pm.  While it is a bit hard to get to if you are not a Cal Poly student/ staff & have a parking pass, it is thefree parking feature on most weekends that benefit all.The only other Bagel places in any nearby town that make Bagels closeat about 3 pm.This Bagel place does sell a bakers dozen with two small tub of cream cheese for about $18.  They have the ever popular "Everything" as well as, a fair assortment of others. They also do make the NY style of Bagels & lox.This location is right in the middle of the Cal Poly Village for students.
5, If you want to wait 30 minutes for a good bagel then come to Einstein's!
2, Sufficiently fast service and good sandwiches.  Prices are good but not an amazing value.  
4, Tasty food. Probably the best place on campus. Slightly expensive though.
4, Couldn't go in because of no public parking. Great location for the cal poly students staying in the nearby dorms. Not really designed for the general public access

[awesome lobster roll and chowder! toasted bun was just right and kept the overflowing lobster on its path into my mouth. the freshness of the celery provided a nice flavor companion. the chowder was deliciously creamy and had perfect bite sized chunks of clam and potatoes. would go again.
5, We have eaten here twice while in SLO & it was very good both times. And the most important thing, it has a parking lot might not be an empty spot, but, your chances are better than finding a spot on the street.
5, The new one downtown was awful Blan no flavor hardly any clams in the chowder. So being unsatisfied I went to the one on Monterey Street the old one. And it was like night and day and give the splash on Monterey five stars. But they should shut down the new one that’s in the courtyard
3, Wonderful food and service. Staff is always in a good mood
5, This place was delicious. Fresh everything. My husband got the half pastrami sandwich on pesto focaccia bread that was simply divine with a bowl of amazing clam chowder. Literally the best I've EVER tasted. I got a grilled salmon sandwich with a house made caper sauce. The customer service was out of this world. It's a must stop by when in town or pass through. Or if you lucky enough to live near by.They also have amazing looking desserts. We were too full to try but I have no doubt it's tasty. One thing to consider is, our orders did not some with any fries or sides in case your wondering.

[Great place with friendly and fast service. Had the tri tip sandwich, family had hot dog and chicken. Tenders. Food was great. Would recommend this place to friends
5, I had the cheese steak and onion rings. Our food came out fast. The steak was tough and obviously old, and rewarmed. The onion rings were hot on the outside, cold and we'll cooked inside, and very greasy. Like they were prepared in advance.
1, Great for watching sports, but the food is small and tasteless. My daughter got the child's menu shrimp and chips and was shocked to only see 3 shrimp. We came home and she ate a second lunch.My sandwich (BALT) was bland, disappointing.The onion rings were good!
3, We went their with kids, and loved that there was extra seating away from the louder main area. Unfortunately the 1 year old was unable to use the high chair due to broken straps. And only got 4 jalapeño poppers in the appetizer. Food was decent, pricey for what it was however and my burger didn't come with any fixings, which was unexpected.
3, fantastic food for the price, clean atmosphere, and friendly staff. I love the mushroom, cheese and avacado burger...DELICIOUS!

[I'm a little meh on this place. Food is alright, definitely small portions though. Dessert is pretty bad, whatever we got, some cookie ice cream thing. Service is good though, and it's snazzy and clean. We were a table of 12 though and asked to split the check 3 ways and the server looked a little angry. If you're looking to class it up, it's a nice place, but if you're looking to eat well and be full, you're probably better off down the road.
3, Our favorite place to go in SLO. Staff is always friendly and the tapas (especially the bacon-wrapped dates and the bocadillos) and specialty cocktails and pitchers of drinks are AMAZING! We will always return for more.
5, Luna Red is a great place to have diner! The atmosphere is really pleasant (either in the patio or inside) and the food is really good. Hoummous is delightful and tacos are pretty good too.Definitely a place to stop by when staying in San Luis!
5, Popular, trendy place overlooking the San Luis creek and the mission.  Amazing tapas sized sharable dishes for lunch and dinner. Great breakfasts, too.
5, Definitely a great Tapas and drink venue in beautiful downtown San Luis Obispo...go between 3p and 6p for the Tapas specials and drinks, sit on the patio.  Don't miss the olive bread with rosemary garlic chili aioli.

[Honestly, I've never had a worse cinnamon roll. My banana-Nutella roll was small, overpriced, covered in a poorly-made frosting with altogether too much butter, bereft of bananas, and served slowly and clumsily.  That sounds harsh, but it's well-deserved.
2, Tried it twice and was not impressed. Service is amazing but cinnamon rolls were very dry. Good amount of frosting and cinnamon but the bread part of the roll was below average.
2, amazing cinnamon rolls, but weird times that they're open that change occasionally and once I went and they were out of cinnamon rolls...
4, I believe they changed owners. Ive gone twice and they've been closed with a sign says equipment failure, second time I called they said open. I get there it was closed with sign says" cinnamon rolls have not been delivered system failure" the only thing failing is the business!! Bye never again!!
1, Did they change ownership recently? I just bought some today and they are larger and drier than they used to be. They just werent very soft and moist.

[Might be the only decent bagel in San Luis Obispo. While the staff turns over about as often as you would expect a college town bagel shop to, it is a testament to their hiring practices that they always seem to have friendly young people ready to politely make you a bagel. I have been eating bagels here with varying regularity since 2004 and have not been disappointed yet.
4, Love the pretzel rolls here, super good with a glass of yerba mate. The staff is very nice and personable even when they are swamped. I'd try to avoid Friday mornings as it seems to be crazy busy.
5, Lots of different bagels and fun selection of cream cheeses. Usually quick turnaround but can get very busy, especially in the morning
5, You f****** people got the place where I was at Taco King and the food was great how's the back Ally and s***
1, Place has great food and a super friendly staff. I would highly recommend trying there top hat on a whole wheat everything bagel. Or for lunch California panini.

[I walked in for lunch. Stood by the front to be seated, looked around, made eye contact with 3 servers, yet no one ever came by to seat me. I finally grabbed a menu and seated myself. I sat there waited, made eye contact with several employees, waited, waited, waited. There was only one other table seated, but about 8 employees visible on the floor. I waited, waited and waited. A server finally came by and I said Hi as if she might take my order. She said Hi and kept walking by, so I thought well eventually someone is going to come take my order. I waited and waited, eventually I just got up and walked out.
1, Outstanding restaurant Everything was delicious from the bread to the salad , steak , potatoes green beans Wonderful service by Lisa JayWill be back
5, I have such great memories of this place. Always received friendly service and great food!
5, The service was the Horrible. And for the last 2 hours i have been plucking. Will NEVER go back..... very disappointed.
1, Service was slow. Food was definitely overpriced. I suspect that some of the stuff is frozen/made off-site. Small soda costs 3.29. This place reminds me of a restaurant that would be on a Gordon Ramsay show.

[I decided to check this place out a few days ago because I wanted to try their sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on a ciabatta roll. I arrived around 11:30am. expecting to order this item, but was unfortunately helped by an employee named Morgan was very rude and shrill, and frankly shouldn't be working in customer service. I didn't know that breakfast service ended at 10:30am. It was pointed out to me by Morgan, where the notice is at the bottom of the menu in small letters. I said, "Having that notice at the bottom is very misleading to customers and it's bad customer service." Morgan said, "No, it's not. We're not an all-day breakfast place." Really, she should have shown some empathy instead, offering a solution to my breakfast dilemma by saying, "I'm sorry, we stop serving breakfast at 10:30am, but here are some other choices for you." I became frustrated with her snippy attitude and flabbergasted I would be treated this way, but I was pretty hungry, so I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and an orange juice. She asked if I wanted my receipt, and I said, "No," and then she VIOLENTLY grabbed the receipt from my hand and threw it away, then just stormed off and presumably complained about my behavior to her other coworkers. If I hadn't paid for my food, I would have asked to speak to her manager right then and there. NOBODY deserves to be treated this way, Morgan. I've been in customer service for over 25 years, and you ALWAYS treat your customers with RESPECT, even if you don't agree with them. I will contact Panera corporate about this incident tomorrow (12/19).
1, I go here on occasion for my work lunches and I am typically in a hurry so I order to go. I typically get a grilled cheese and a Caeser salad. The last couple times I have gone there and asked for the dressing to be tossed on the salad, NOT on the side,  and I have been given a salad with a side of dressing. I clearly do not have time to do it myself, so 3 of the times i brought it back to have them fix it. This final time though I did not, because I was so fed up with how incompetent the staff is that they cannot read a simple direction. TOSS THE SALAD. not only was the salad not tossed but they gave me like half a cup of dressing, I had to use my own at home to make it " a salad" not worth the 6 dollars AT ALL. I would not care as much if I were not rushing but I had stuff to do places to go and didn't have time, but I was in a hurry, and just left the place mad.Long story of it, don't get specific, they just DON'T GET IT.
2, Its okay place. Doesn’t have sweet tea. But all different flavors of it. Not so cool place
2, It's a chain.so with that out of the way.. most of the "ade" drinks/ teas were empty and appeared to have been for some time.  Simple addition of olives to the order was forgotten. When asked for the forgotten olives, a whopping heaping pike of 4 old olives were provided. Appears to be run and managed by 4 high schoolers, floor unswept and a few tables with crumbs still them.. but as stated it's a chain..what do you expect.. as for the food.. not good not bad
2, Nothing special, service wasn’t great, forgot part of my order, and it was slow. Has potential definitely lots of room for improvement!

[This is a great spot! I was thrilled to find a small place dedicated to vegan eats! I ordered the all day breakfast (burrito version) and wasn’t disappointed. The burrito was huge and I wasn’t able to finish it. I also grabbed a chocolate donut on the way out and enjoyed it on the way back home. If I am in the area, I’ll be sure to stop by again.
5, Bliss Cafe was amazing.  We stopped on our way to Santa Barbara, and we liked it so much we stopped on our way back home.  The highlight was the included salad, which most customers seem to not take advantage of.  I had the Pineapple Teriyaki  the first time, and the Ginger Broccoli the second time.  Both were great, though the second was more unique.  We're thinking of our next vacation in Santa Barbara just to go back!  I'm going to try to get recipes from the owner.
5, Great place for vegans (I'm not so don't want to give them a poor rating, but my brother in law and his wife loved the place and they are vegan. They said they recommend)
5, Came from Orange County to SLO for the first time. Found Bliss cafe and decided to try it for breakfast. The cashier and waiter are very friendly and polite. I decided to try the all day breakfast burrito and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! The rest of my party were 5 and they loved the food also. Definately coming back to Bliss without a doubt.
5, The avocado lemon love salad was so good I forgot to take a photo. I’m in love.

[Went in on a Sunday around 10:30 and ordered from their brunch menu. The restaurant wasn't too full so staffing was likely minmal. Food took a little while but nothing outlandish. We never got any coffee refills while eating or waiting. We ordered the Red Flannel Hash and it was pretty tasty. Everything was cooked nicely and was presented in a nice cast iron skillet. The unfortunate thing is the skillet was less than half full. The poached eggs were nicely done but the amount of hash that we got was to be honest a bit disappointing. I would try eating there again but for 15 dollars for a hash that was roughly a cup you'll end up feeling a bit short changed.
3, Killer happy hour deal, peaceful outdoor spot to drink in the back. Could have had more dogs to pump up the vibes. Will be back for mystery concert, posters in the front unclear on when they are but will show up anyhow!
4, WILL be returning here for sure! Everything on the menu looked amazing, but I couldn't resist the grilled cheese special, OMG! Goat cheese, mozzarella, fig jam, arugula, with a side salad, ridiculously decadent. Sat out back creekside, highly recommend.... listening to the awesome 80s music jamming, seriously a great way to end the weekend. Easy bike ride from where I'm staying and to catch the train home, right in center of town. Sorry, final note... server Daniel was great. Better service than other local places rated highly, IMO.
5, Customer service is great, however food is ok. The brews are good
3, Great place to check out the local vibes and have a cold beer. Service was good and reasonably priced.

[Incredibly friendly staff. Totally welcoming if you just want to browse, but also have tons of impressive artwork with great character.
5, I like this place. It's a small gallery and the people there are friendly and helpful. As non-buyer I found it was a pleasant experience.
5, I get a hat for juggling an a dollar.
1, Great, small gallery with fantastic, friendly staff and some really unique pieces
5, This gallery is wonderful.  I couldn't believe the art they have.  A lot is very art deco which I like.  Heard the story of Steve Thomas who was commissioned the The National Parks to recreate art deco posters of all the National Parks.  The owner of Just Looking saw these and decided he not only wanted to carry prints of these, he wanted to commission Steve Thomas to create posters of California beginning with San Luis Obispo and the rest of San Luis Obispo County.  These are very diverse, and in all different sizes.  Now you can buy (as far as I know only here!) any of these, plus any of the national park posters, and others like Santa Fe, and sites in Florida.

[Love to visit Novo for Lunch or Dinner whenever I am in SLO. Great fusion menu with thoughtfully prepared dishes and selected ingredients. Great selection of wines including local and import plus extensive cocktail and liquor  menu to choose from. Novo boasts fantastic service and the patio is incredible both during the day and at night...if possible get a table with a creekside view! Great for a date or to enjoy a meal with a group of friends. Parking is available on the street, reservations recommended.
5, Very cute ambiance creekside. Came here with a party of 8. Everyone enjoyed their food! I quite liked my savory crepe. Total bill came out to $163. The only complaint I have is that our food took a very long time to come out...
4, A Californian fusion restaurant as it offers quite a few Asian dishes.  If course, we skipped those, with the exception of the shrimp roll which I thought was good, but the skin was kind of dried up (probably made ahead).  The scallops were wonderfully delicious, cooked just right, great sauce.  The racks of lamb were pretty good, a bit overcooked.  Of course, the patio seating area was a great place to enjoy these delicious dishes!
4, Great and different food in nice stream side outdoor dining.
4, Food was below average. They tried to make up for it with very large portions. Service was good

[Great selection of all smoking needs and other stuff you didn’t know you needed but totally do. Tons of art (glass and not!!) local and not, too. Love the staff and the owner! Basically will help you with whatever you need/any questions really. Have special ordered me stuff before! Been coming here for almost 10 years now, but this is their newly moved location. A lot smaller than the old one, but still almost as great of selection. WAYYY better than the other shops in slo.
5, Great selection of art glass which I focused on but it looked like a selection of vapes

[The food was delicious and unique. I ordered the grilled cheese and loved it. It was just the right twist on a favorite meal. It came with a good portion of salad with delicious dressing that I wish they sold by the bottle (although I didn't ask so maybe they do). My mom ordered the tuna melt and was just as satisfied. We had the veggie and lentil soup to share and enjoyed that as well and loved the bread that came with it. The tea and coffee was also just as good as the food if not better. Loved everything about this place!
5, The Best Bud is a grilled sandwich. Chicken, Brie and apples were the highlights of this lunchtime treat. It was paired with a salad drizzled with a mustard dressing. I asked for pecans and aoli to be left out of the sand which. It came the the offending allergens inside. It took awhile but they remade it and it was delicious. They threw in a free beverage for the wait.  This is a popular local spot. A bit out of the way but worth the jaunt.
4, I had the breakfast burrito with the sausage & caramelized onions with a side of salsa. I could eat that every day it was so good. The salsa has made my top ten list.  “SOOOO GOOD”
5, This cafe is truly one of a kind, nestled in the cozy corner of SLO. If you are passing through SLO on highway 101, make some time to stop here for breakfast or lunch to try their awesome farm to table menu. I had their breakfast egg burrito and cup of black coffee. The burrito was absolutely delicious, fresh avocado, pinto beans, hash-browns, spinach and egg wrapped in warm tortilla with a side of creamy sauce. They have a small outdoor seating area and comfortable open indoor seating.
5, Great coffees, and really yummy, fresh foods that change with the seasons. Pumpkin waffles are amazing! Off beat location, but cute and convenient to the train station.

[Good selection of baked goods and food choices.  Decent coffee, to be honest though the mocha tastes like warm milk. Last 3 tines I went I was thoroughly disappointed with my coffee. For a coffee shop, kind of a bummer. I like hot, robust coffee, somewhat missing those metrics.
2, The drinks run hot but if you give yourself a minute or two the flavor really comes out. Great staff, great cafe vibe, and so far my fave for coffee in San Luis Obispo.
4, The staff were nice, the tea was great, and the Blueberry Lemon Poppy seed muffin was amazing!  Will definitely stop in again!
4, Service is great. Coffee is fair priced. A nice place to sit and visit with no pressure.
5, The staff at ALL the Blackhorses in town are always super helpful and friendly 😊

[Love the variety of clothing and accessories. I will be visiting more often, great place to shop - Oh, they accept BitCoins which is a double plus!!!
5, It seems like it could truly be a wonderful shop, but they keep their own hours, there is absolutely no way to predict if it is even worth it to show up! Their items are wonderful quality, so much so that the best item of clothing I ever owned was from there but sadly was stolen during a trip. I went to return to the shop again many times to see if they have similar items, but I have never been able to purchase anything because during normal working hours, the store is almost -always-closed. How do you expect to run a business this way? Is there some kind of problem? How can you pretend like your store is special and spiritually sound and all this when you don't even care about your customers? Is Hempshak trying to go out of business? As it stands, I think I would have better luck hitchhiking my way to New York with a giant gorilla, twenty-two tons of weoponry and a nuclear bomb. Luckily it's not in my resume, but Thank you and goodnight.
1, Lovely store! Owner is always super helpful, and the store is full of beautiful art and handcrafted clothing!
5, Great place to find all types of hemp products in the San Luis Obispo area. Friendly staff always there to answer questions. We purchased some hemp lotion and Hemptopia t-shirts and were very pleased.

[Very nice atmosphere and excellent food. The staff was all very friendly and accommodating.   The restaurant was busy on Friday night and we waited an hour.  The manager told me the crowd starts thinning out at around 8 and he was right.  We got there at 6:30 and waited an hour.  It was worth it and I would strongly recommend this place.
5, Went to this restaurant for a friends graduation. They had our reservation on time and reserved which some places fault on. Our service was excellent and they were constantly keeping the table refreshed with bread and clearing dirty dishes. Our waiter was very professional and knew everything on the menu. I had a seafood pasta dish that was perfectly cooked and very tasty. Everyone else also enjoyed their dishes and did not hear any complaints. Desserts were made in house and extremely delicious as well. Highly recommend Giuseppe’s to anyone in the area.
5, EXCELLENT Italian food! Beautiful outdoor patio dining, great menu, delicious pasta, would 100% recommend. Can't wait to go back! The only place I've ever been too that b instead of just oil and balsamic with parmesan, they had herbs and fresh minced garlic in the dipping mix. So freaking good!!
5, Best Italian food in SLO.  Like an old time SF Italian restaurant   Will keep coming back for more.  Love this place
5, Ok...have lunch at a table inside....or the rear patio...or on a sidewalk bistro table! One piece of pizza will fill you up and the salads are amazing.  Great staff too!  On Monterey just a block from the Mission.

The staff were excellent, engaging and attentive. A credit to the town. I have to recommend people to try their beer.

4, An absolute central coast gem. I've been coming here now for almost 10 years and I've never had less than a five star experience. The seasonal specials are dynamic, their bartenders are expert mixologists, the wait staff is knowledge and attentive, you can tell they definitely aren't there for a summer job. Even the vegetarian options are flavorful and considerate given this is a meat heavy town.
5, It was our 25th anniversary dinner and they treated us exceptionally! From the bar to the table the service was spot on and the dishes were amazing. Olivia our server was a doll and made the experience enjoyable. I highly recommend table 12

[Mixed. Friendly, but far from prompt service, even coming in at a slow time. Asked to cash out early twice for the bartender so they could get their tip. Food was great, but mixed drinks were extremely weak by all standards. I used to work at a bar myself for years.  Honestly, probably won't go back. Lots of great places to eat that will do better. Good location.
3, This place was great when I was in school but I visited just recently and it's way different. I was there for 2 for 1s and they were serving in plastic cups instead of glass (very wasteful) so there were huge trash cans full of cups scattered around. Additionally the music was louder and the lighting was lower, making it seem like they were going for a club vibe AND all the cool tiki decor was gone (but they might have just been painting or cleaning, hard to tell). Overall, sad to see this once classy and fun establishment go through such a downgrade.
1, Great food, amazing atmosphere. Inside and outside dining. Love this place! Great for Sunday football, so I'm told.
5, Great food great atmosphere and great service a definite repeat
5, They were out of crown 6pm on a Monday. Food wasn’t anything special. Bartender let drink run out then took his sweet time to cash me out.

[This place was quiet on a Sunday morning for brunch. Service was excellent, as well as the food. And the coffee was perfect. I really wanted a breakfast cocktail, but did not partake. Five stars for brunch.
5, Great place for wonderful cocktails. Tiki Tuesdays are for sure my favorite. The staff knows their stuff and make excellent recommendations.
5, Whisky and Mezcal you won't find anywhere else between LA and The Bay. Hardworking staff. Great atmosphere. Grown, mature crowd offers refuge from the party crazed masses on Higuera without being uncool or divey. If you want a true cocktail in SLO at a place you can have an actual conversation in, this is it.
5, Get the french toast if you are here during brunch. Delicious.
4, Best cocktails and cocktail happy hour (4-6) in SLO.

[Excellent.  This was one of the best spare ribs I’ve ever had.  They were cooked perfectly and the sides were the best. Rarely to I have baked beans and absolutely love them.  I would go back just for the beans and potato salad it was so good. The service was prompt and friendly.  The place was very relaxing and clean.  I will definitely go back.  Great place.
5, This is one of the greatest Barbecue places in San Luis Obispo, I really enjoyed my food and the great customer service. Portions are just right, not too much and not too little. I even bought a Shirt with the logo from here, that's how great it was.
5, The wings were arguably the best in SLO! Enjoyed the tacos too! Beautiful place! It would be great to have a full service bar though...I'll be baaack!
4, Great BBQ spot in a great intersection.  The building is really great with Windows all around so this is perfect for people-watching while you're eating. Moe's is a San Luis Obispo classic spot. If you're visiting town and looking for great BBQ you can't beat them.
5, I would rate my visit 1/5. But I usually enjoy mos. I love the food. And it's always super yummy so I can't give you a Terrible star rating.But today I came in with my service dog. He wasn't wearing his vest at the time because it was left in my other car. And the woman (who was working Monday 5/9 at 3:50pm) told me I could not have my dog. And so I told her he was my service dog. And this is were my experience goes down hill. She rolls her eyes at me and says oh okay. Then when then next lady came up in line as we were going to sit down. The woman behind the counter says to the customer with quite an attitude. "He's a SERIVICE animal."My boyfriend showed her his ID card. And there was no apology.

[Great food, excellent service, and they were open on Christmas (which is not normally something that happens in SLO). We had a great time.
5, Nice small bar with friendly staff.  I usually stop in to have a drink when I am visiting and the staff is always friendly and remebers my drink order, impressive!
5, Slightly cramped, but good. Great food that tastes great if slightly under presented. Prices a little steep, but as with the area this seems to be the norm.
4, Good pub. Perfect atmosphere. Ok food. They could expand the beer list

4, I called and asked if they would have sezechuan sauce. They said they had sezechuan sauce. They never had sezechuan sauce. They'll never have sezechuan sauce.
1, Used the 'order here' kiosk thinking the order would get in quickly, but I was wrong. People coming in after us recieved their order before ours. More disappointing was they put cheese on a quarter of my sons chicken sandwich, who has sensory issues and will not eat food if he sees cheese on it. We definitely will not return unless it's for soft drinks.
2, Always friendly.  Always cleaning out waiting on customers.  Great deals on sodas and ice cream.  Salads are good.  
5, I called this location to see if they were doing any specials. The woman that answered could not speak English. Sad location. I won't be going to this location ever!

[Nice little used book store. Exactly what you'd expect, stacks of books lining the floors and the walls, going up the staircases. I love the smell of the place.Not much reading in other languages other than the occasional book. Lots of old paperback westerns.I find myself in this store every few weeks to explore and find something new to read.
4, Excellent, eclectic and ever-changing selection of used and antique books. Always worth a stop.
5, A book lovers' paradise, with piles of books and shelves that are bursting at the edges with amazing reading material.
5, Love visiting this book store!  Floor to ceiling books! A sight to be seen for sure. If you are a book lover, your jaw will drop at the shear numbers of books. We usually stop in anytime we are in SLO. 
5, Phoenix is great if you go in to browse, you'll most likely always find something cool to pick up. Go in looking for a specific title and most likely you'll walk away empty handed. The staff is great, always helpful and pretty knowledgeable.

[Can't believe I've lived in the area for several years and had never been to Del Monte Cafe until last weekend. I went for breakfast on Sunday and had the vegetarian eggs benedict. Wow, the food was flavorful and filling. Although the service was a little slow, the staff were all friendly. I'll definitely be back
5, Love this place! Home-style goodness that warms the belly. Great patio to enjoy the beautiful SLO days with breakfast or lunch. This is the first place each of our children went to after they were born. So much love for Del Monte
5, Got the "southwest" chorizo scramble. Delicious! Good service & nice small town diner type feeling.
4, Dropped in for ice cream after getting off Amtrak for a short layover. Picked up a vanilla shake instead. They ran out of chocolate ice cream, which is what I really wanted. The waitress was courteous and fast. There were a few people in the outside eating area and their food looked delicious when it was plated to be served--some avocado slices neatly arrange on top. The place was clean and neat with a 50's/60's flair. If we had more time, we would have eaten there.
3, Went here with the kids after swim lessons, it was a bit of a lark... we all came away very satisfied per the meal, and we he kids loved the nostalgic diner experience.  The building sort of throws you back in time a bit, but the service was great.  My only complaint was the flies, not to many but enough that it was a little annoying.

[The thermostat seems to be stuck at the oddly low temperature of a back-kitchen freezer, but other than that, coffee enthusiasts from all cups of life can appreciate the diversity in their selections. Aside the minimal effort in serving anything other than coffee, this is a great place for socializing and enjoying some good brew
4, For being a coffee house chain in a sea of local coffee houses, this place holds its own. Stephanie took my complicated order with no problems at all, and Bailey made it to perfection. My order was a large iced nonfat vanilla latte with sugar free syrup and one pump of white chocolate. The drink had the perfect amount of foam and flavor. I will absolutely return for my next coffee fix.
5, I have yet to have there actual coffee but there teas are definitely 5 star worthy. Whether it be hot or cold the, sweet or unsweetened the teas are good.
5, Best coffee we have tasted in this country.. sorry the are not everywhere... but so happy there are a few .. while traveling we look for Peets first.... even the decaf is fantastic.. enjoy Major Dickensen blend.. and their house blend..
5, Calm and nice place in downtown SLO to enjoy a good coffee and pastries. The staff is super nice.

[I loved my experience here at Gennaro's! My boyfriend and I stopped in on New Year's Eve hopeful for a cancellation. Delightfully enough for us (to the sorry luck of some couple with the flu- please get better!) we were able to have a window seat where we enjoyed a delightful antipasto plate, wine and the most satisfying dessert of flowerless chocolate cake that was made with complete excellence! Service was perfection and the atmosphere can not be beat! Will 100% be back!
5, The ambiance is great. Small converted small Victorian house. The night we were there was extremely quiet. However either my chair or the floor was leaning. The food was good but nothing extraordinary or the quality that would bring me back.
3, The food was excellent as was the service.  Ate lamb chops best I have ever eaten.  Great wine selection, flour less chocolate cake to die for.

4, Go for the great beer (and decent cider) detection. But, for the love of God, stay away from the food. I've gotten food poisoning here a couple times, and so has my boyfriend and an ex-coworker. Ordering food here is a real crapshoot... pun intended, as that's what will be shooting out of you.

Make sure to check out all the sale/clearance areas!  I can spend hours here discovering new authors and browsing different sections.  I have always been able to find good nature/science books and field guides, the sci do section is great, and don't forget to check out all the board games!
5, Really enjoy bringing the kids here for books. An in-store Starbucks, and all the books you need, it's easy to spend a couple of quality hours with the kids, or finding a book that is just for you. The is friendly, but not bugging you about "how long" you've been there. And should you need a little help finding something specific, there is always someone close by to help you.
4, There was absolutely no staff on the floor ( upstairs or down) to assist and when we finally found an info station it was at the end of the checkout line so we were blocking the people leaving. The girl that helped me was pleasant enough however I was looking for 2 books that are Barnes and Noble Classics, they don't carry them in store...what? They are B and N branded! Not a pleasant experience.
1, Very helpful and friendly staff. The store itself is also very clean and organized. Out of all the barns and nobels I've been to, this is one of my favorites! I go every time I'm in town

5, Great service, just a small store so few seating options indoors.  They do have seats outside though so that opens things up in warm weather.
4, Salted caramel mocha extra good when they add a light sprinkle of salt to the blend😙.
5, Quick in & out. Not too many wierdos.
5, Great service and all the workers always have a smile on their faces. Bathrooms are nice too and CLEAN!

[First impression is that they look the same as your high end coffee bar. But, do not be fooled by its' cover. They have extremely high standards.  Their coffee making is an art form! Warning, if you visit this place no other place ever will do!
5, First visit at new location. Very busy at 2:30. Trendy crowd. Limited coffee menu, but welcoming atmosphere and friendly staff.
4, Great coffee shop with a very nice staff. Very open an comfortable.
4, Usually pretty busy. But great service and yummy coffee
5, With good coffee being commonplace now, does it really matter which one I stop at?  YES!    This place was a coffee roaster first, selling specially blended coffee to restaurants, and their coffee is great!  They then opened the cafe and made it a super casual, comfortable place.  Don't let that fool you, though, the staff are relaxed but they are really working for you, just making it look easy.  It must be a good place to work!  And the roaster now gets to do single origins and new blends, whatever the beans seem to want, this has got to be more fun than blending for the same restaurants every week.

[Great local place, outdoor seating. Fine selection of Irish Whiskey. Many beers on draft, shuffleboard,  jukebox. Excellent bartenders...
5, A good place to drink Jameson's. They were the largest Jameson's distributor in the U.S.  so clearly they cater to the Irish Whiskey lovers. The staff is friendly and attentive. We stop every time we're in town.
5, Best bar in town. Ask paddy for the best bloody Mary in town. He works Sundays early.

[Such a cool and unique addition to the vintage and home-goods shops in San Luis Obispo. And it's not just vintage... They have new items in all the time. The custom made furniture is really cool as well. And well-priced for a one-of -a-kind piece! Also, the owners are maybe the nicest guys around. Stop by for a casual conversation and check out their ceramic place settings, really cool outdoor stuff from Poler, jewelry, candles, etc!

[Amazing coffee!  Wonderful atmosphere.  Great outdoor seating.  Really cool scene with vintage skateboards on the wall and other neat art.  Staff is super nice and the owner Brett is an admirable and rad dude!  Overall great experience!!!
5, My favorite coffee shop ever. It has its really busy times but the line moves fast. Cool vibes and nice people. Of course, the coffee and coffee drinks are amazing, but the food is also fantastic. Love the garlic chicken flatbread and the breakfast burrito.
5, Nutty bean coffee is legendary.  Their salads and wraps are fresh, original and quite memorable. Patio seating is quaint. A great 2-4 people meeting place.
5, Fun little place! Tasty food in just-right portions. I'm not a coffee drinker but I might try some of their delicious-sounding drinks. Decor rocks.
5, This place is simply amazing. Great service, great coffee, great tea, great food, and the best breakfast burrito in town!

[Love Kreuzberg Cafe. Literally can't stop going back. Everything from when you walk in is enjoyable. The employees, the environment, the setting. Delicious selection of both drinks and food.
5, This is an amazing cafe, and really just soothing. It's a kind of hip/retro/alternative. The music is calming and the environment and the energy is just very peaceful and puts you in a sense of ease. The coffee here is amazing 💕😍. The food is good, a little tip is don't get the broccoli soup 😂. The turkey pesto is a flavorful sandwich that I encourage you guys to try, I assure you it will not disappoint. Enjoy!!! 😘
5, This coffee shop is really cool and definitely had lasted longer than I thought it would. They roast the coffee on site And make the breakfast foods there as well. The coffee is well made and tastes great. The staff is hit or miss (thus the 4/5) and sometimes can be amazing and other times can be snobby, hipster kids. This is a great place to come to get a delicious cup of coffee or latte and sit and read a good book or study for a few hours. I would recommend it for it's atmosphere and ambiance if not for the staff. 
4, Good espresso drinks for sure. Good lunch food too. Great decor. Funny that it's called after a hip neighborhood in Berlin while Berlin is not such a great place for coffee.
5, Coffee is great and there's this one Barista that's a total cutie.  His name is Julian and he actually helped me find out what my favorite coffee drink is; a double shot Mocha.  Incredibly informative, friendly, and did I mention cute? ;) #whatahunk

[I've been coming here for over a decade, including the old location, and it's always been fantastic. I do miss the wall of drinks they had at the old location, but it's easier to park at the new place so trade offs I guess. There food is always served quick and hot. Get their gyros, either the plate or the sandwich.
5, Really friendly staff and the food is great. Had the pita, gyro, and chicken shawarma and all of it was great. It is a perfect place to stop in for some fast Mediterranean food that is full of flavor.  Looking forward to going back.
5, I'm from out of town and wasn't familiar with the menu, the staff helped me out and I LOVED what I had! Great portion sizes and the garlic pita bread was INCREDIBLE! Highly recommend, very delicious!
5, Such yummy food. I highly recommend the lentil soup and hummus. Clean restaurant, friendly staff, and good service
5, Rock freaking solid. My whole family loves this place. Comfortable, good pricing, friendly staff, and great food. Don't change, Jaffa! My only complaint is that my man Adnan isn't around anymore.

[I fell in love with the cozy patio, then realized: this good feeling was not reciprocated! This is my 4th visit, and every time I order I wonder 'what just happened'. The other customers are very nice, but the staff is exceptionally unfriendly, unhelpful and have not once smiled. After 4 visits, this cannot be coincidence. I will not be back!!
1, Friendly staff, great coffee, and a variety of good food. They also have plenty of vegan baked goods.
5, The food and drink were great. Lots of gluten free options. But the indoor seating felt like I was in a library. About 10 other patrons were there for lunch, each on their own table with a drink working on their laptops. All dead quite. The patio out back would have been wonderful, but it was 109 degrees outside that day.
4, I love their coffee! the staff is very friendly and it's a perfect spot to study or just hang for hours!
5, One of my favorite, comfy hangouts! Absolutely.  Two issues take it down to 4 stars. The garden is fantastic until some chuckleheads decide it's a nice place for a conference call for work, or a bunch of coeds think they need to share their feelings with all the tables. And the lunch items are usually too organic, vegan froo-froo for me to eat there. Great light breakfast though!

3, Coffe is expensive....so are a lot of things everywhere else. Good service good coffee good people 👍
4, Usually my Starbucks visits are pleasant.  I'm thinking the staff here needs some additional training and coaching.  They seemed bored and  the coffee maker gentleman with dark hair seemed to busy on his phone texting.
2, This is my favorite coffee shop, I go there at night because the night crowd is very friendly. This particular coffee shop is one of our towns most popular hang outs at night, it is a very social place, even the town police socialize when they are in there. The atmosphere is laid back and full of smiles. I highly recommend this place, you will feel welcome.

[We own many Beautiful Feet Books products and love them all! My children adore all of the books in the Early American History Elementary pack. As a parent and teacher, I appreciate the open-and-go nature of all of the study guides. We own History, Science and Character. Each study guide is laid out in such a way that I can open to a lesson I want to cover, see which books or pages we need to read, and complete the lesson without extensive preparation on my part. Each book we've used from Beautiful Feet Books is of high literary merit, moral integrity and teaches the material in personal, engaging ways. We will continue to use and purchase Beautiful Feet Books products!
5, I'm so excited to do the geography and character studies with my children this year. The character study guide is well laid out and gives such thought-provoking questions. I also love the fact that there are lots of extra suggested titles for us to explore. I also bought the D'Aulaire biography set...I've had my eye on those a long while!! This is gonna be a great year!
5, We are using the Early American History Primary Guide and books, along with the Teaching Character through literature and love EVERY bit of both studies!  Beautiful Feet Books produces quality materials and we as a family wholeheartedly recommend this company to those looking to provide their children with a feast of beautiful ideas.  The lessons are just deep enough, and yet simple enough to complete several each week for a range of children.  We use ours for our 1st grader, 3rd grader and 5th grader and it is appropriate for all levels.  We look forward to making Beautiful Feet Books a part of our homeschool for the years to come!
5, We've used several of the geography books, CA History oack, History of Science pack, and some d'ulaire books.  We've been pleased with it all.  Will definitely be buying more from here.
5, We have used several of their study guides now and they are wonderful!  We have LOVED the majority of the books, and they work perfectly as read-alouds for all the children together.

[Love this place, especially around the holiday season. The staff seem to be super friendly and helpful. Every time we pass by the place, I am drawn in by the great smells.
5, Now that they have their own app that everyone can download and use to get rewards, makes more fun to shop here. Especially when they have they're seasonal things like, pumpkin spice, etc. Great deals too.
4, Super helpful and attentive staff. I needed help finding a new scent, as my old favorite had been discontinued, and I was treated like a VIP! The staff offered informed opinions based upon real knowledge of the store's wares. And, with very little input, helped me to choose a new favorite,  and which products in that line were best suited to my needs.
5, A pretty standard Bath and Body Works is perched on this corner and is always kept nice and clean. Can get quite crowded on Thursdays during farmers.
4, Helpful staff even with huge sale!

[Shopped for a 3rd old's bday party and we found everything we needed.  The owners were extremely helpful and the party was a huge hit, the balloon section was great!
5, I o ordered some balloons for my daughter's birthday party that day early. As I came to pick them up I was sharing with the employee that they were for the next day she looked at me and said that these would not hold up for that long so she asked if I had a little more time and she made it the same bouquets of balloons with the high float so I would have nice balloons at the party . I appreciated that she took the time to tell me that and didn't leave me hanging.It was my fault but they made it their problem
4, Every random thing I have ever needed they had it! I wish their hours were better but when I do get inside it's just a great little family run business full of every single thing you could ever want!
5, Great local costume shop. They have everything you can think of.
5, Had lots of good stuff! Very crowded

[The "Target Tech" guy was beyond incompetent. What should have taken 20 minutes wound up taking over an hour. Not only did he expect us to sign the Verizon user agreement without viewing it, but he would never confirm our plan or the total monthly price. I'll be shocked if we ever get our $300 bill credit. When we logged into Verizon's portal we discovered that he had even signed us up for the wrong plan. What a nightmare to fix it. Don't get me started on this guy's lack of customer service skills. "One good thing about the temporary staff being gone, they can't steal anything anymore" That's not a professional thing to say, out of the blue, to a customer.
1, Purchased an item online that showed only 1 in the store. They pulled the item, messaged me it was ready within an hour. I picked it up the same morning. Start to finish, under 2 hours. (20 minutes drive time each way.)
5, Nice, clean store. Friendly people. I would probably shop there more if it were closer primarily for the grocery options as they seem to have some good deals. The red color scheme is hard on my eyes though and I can't stay long. The whole restroom/changing room policy thing awhile back was a big turn off too.
3, Had to seek out 3 associates to find an item, one person didn't actually work for Target (vendor?), The next guy put this head down when he saw me coming then suggested I try using the target app to find something, the last person at least indicated the item was on a clearance shelf (but not sure where). Not a single person offered to help me. Days of "can I help you find something?",  Target's mantra, are no more.  The cashier never made eye contact with me and never asked if I was able to find what I was looking for. Just terrible customer service all around, I was very disappointed.
2, Plenty of cashiers. Super nice store. This has to be one of the biggest Target stores on Earth

[I had a bad experience at this store, I've bought suits before at other MW stores and had great customer service from them however, this store needs to get better salespeople. One specific salesman kept staring as giving us bad looks at me and my friends like if we were going to steal something, he was murmuring something to another salesperson about us and both kept giving us bad looks so we just left the store. This store really needs to step up their game with their sales personnel. I'm not going to buy from someone who looks at me like if I were some kind of thief, I'm taking my business elsewhere.
1, I am giving 2 stars because only the manager and one of the sales person (nameless) are horrible at their jobs.I was looking for a white casual dress shirt, and the salesmen recommended me a $100 shirt, bit expensive for a casual shirt, maybe for a dress shirt but dam.. Expensive. (reasons I find out later why), he told me it was my SIZE, slim fit, and stretch collar. I read the tag and it does say it is a slim fit, stretch collar. Later, I try on the shirt and find out it is to big for me! Even when you tuck in the shirt I looked like a deflated balloon! Big in the chest's, arms, and waist also.So I go back, same day, to return it.The manager says "since it is worn, even ONCE, they don't do returns." How would you know the clothes fit you without wearing it once is my question?! All different brands have different styles and for the amount of money you pay, you should get the style you feel most comfortable in.The manager went on to say that I also had the shirt steamed, which never happened (probably the salesmen lying to him), told me he would never sell a shirt, even if worn once in his store... Really?! I find that hard to believe.Which pissed me off most! When I asked if they can tailor it to fit me! He told me it would take a week, and I had to wait for someone to tailor it, which I waited... Until I found out he started suiting another customer while I was waiting.As a perfect fit member, probably one of my worst experiences at a MW.
2, They need a real tailor and sales people that know what they are talking about.
3, Chelsey L. helped us pick out tux rentals for our wedding.  She was so knowledgeable and extra helpful! She also had great tips to share. We really enjoyed our service and will definitely be going back thank you Chelsey!!
5, They are one of the only stores for men's clothing in town with a consistent stock of sizes.  Staff are very helpful.  The challenge is their extremely poor tailoring.  My husband had to retailor every suit purchased within the last year as they were so poorly done.  They should know better and as a wife I shouldn't have to micro-manage the tailoring when my husband did his final fitting.  The pants were unwearable and the tailor should have redone them.

[It's a messy, busy, store, but I always find great deals in there. Women's shoes, home decor, kitchen and bath linen, and sometimes very inexpensive craft items.
5, Decent place. Usually low stock of product. I'm sure it's due to heavy traffic with the university near by.
3, I can't say the depressingly sterile lighting of ROSS is my kind of aesthetic, but for the bargain-hunting crowd in SLO, this store is an absolute trove of good deals. Great hand-me-downs with style and a low price is a standard here
4, Friendly staff. It's Ross, great prices on clothes, some children's toys, home accessories, jewelry etc. Daily shipments so inventory changes frequently.
3, Great products for great prices, if a bit haphazardly organized.  A big and tall section would be useful.  More signs could help, as I almost didn't notice the downstairs area of the store.  They were also out of stock of a lot of things, a lot of empty shelf space, but maybe they had a really good Friday.

[As a self-made sock connoisseur, I find their selection to be incredibly immense, but I don't think they really execute any single sock design well. Their prices are very reasonable, and the store is a great choice for a fun visit in SLO
4, Fantastic socks! All styles, for men, women and children. Crew and knee-high socks, dress socks or just for fun socks. A novelty sock store. A fun place to visit. Serious athletes should go to a sports store.

[The have the best collection with high-quality stuff. Great experience...
5, Horrible customer experience! I bought a great sweater at this store, I also saw a cute cardigan which was not available in my size, so I went online to check on it. And guess what, most of the things that are in the store are half price. Why in the world would I overpay $60-$100. A lot of stores that sell similar items at least do some sort of price-matching, but this store is just a rip-off. I wanted to return the item, but the store gives only a store credit or exchange, which I was never told during the purchase. I love supporting local stores and businesses, but when they try to rip-off people and do not even have a refund policy, it makes me want to cry.
1, I love Ambiance! Superb style, amazing/helpful staff, a great selection of all my favorite brands, awesome candles & giftable items, and they send me a birthday coupon in the mail that I adore. I stop by a couple times a month, and I tend to buy myself a Free People dress each month. The staff are very attentive and helpful with stylizing wardrobes. I recommend Ambiance not only for every day wear, but also for special occasions. Not to mention, thier accessories have completed multiple of my outfits. Thank you, Ambiance!
5, Selection is hit or miss and overpriced. Staff is unfriendly and rude. Shop Avanti or Black Water for a more pleasurable shopping experience.
1, My wife and I head in there when downtown and it's open, friendly and full of unique clothes, art and jewelry. The owner seems to mix it up and bring a variety of new items in for my wife... to spend our money;)  It's in the perfect location in the heart of downtown. Great store. I recently filmed a viral video and the staff was kind enough to let me work near them. Very friendly people... which is what prompted me to take a moment to comment.

5, Left Coast is AMAZING. I was in SLO for a conference last week and discovered that the t-shirts I had ordered from another company for the event were printed incorrectly. I called Keith at Left Coast and he was able to turn around a new (and totally perfect) order for me within 24 HOURS! I couldn't believe it. Fantastic experience! I will be ordering everything from Left Coast now - they will ship anywhere!
5, Awesome service! Great design and really quick service. Would recommend.

[Enjoy coming here with my wife whenever the both of us are in San luis Obispo. Great clothing picks. Ideas to choose from. Especially when they have they're deals going on.
4, The music is way too loud and the cologne stench is overpowering. 
1, Buena tienda, buena atencion. Solo los precios de muchas cosas están muy altos. Pero buena experiencia 
4, buen local de A & F en un centro comercial muy pintoresco

[So disappointed in Kohl's.  I was underwhelmed at the sales available. For instance men's socks $20 and 1/2 second pair.  Children's clothes, women's PJ's...very few shoes. Dismal.  I left my cart  and walked out of the store today.  At Target, I was able to get everything I needed, including small $5 stocking stuffers on every aisle end rack. That's it for Kohl's. H Smirl
1, The staff is just awesome! Our shopping experiences are always pleasant with the most helpful and genuinely friendly staff!
5, Lots of clothing, housewares, jewelry in stock, but over time the quality seems to be decreasing... Polo shirts are now blended instead of all cotton, for instance. If you get on their mailing lists and stack coupons on top of sales, there are bargains to be had. "Regular" prices have to be high in order to make those discounts possible, so don't get burned by buying at full price.
3, Excellent variety of clothing and some toys and electronics.  I thought it to be a bit pricey, but that's to my taste.
5, Great prices and located near other stores.

[I love shopping at Costco. And for that reason I try to limit my trips. I always over spend then have a problem with finding a place for everything. They have most of the stuff I need at pretty good prices. I love their meats and stock up when I'm there. I got there at the height of the food sampling so it was a little crowded but was able to get around OK. Check out was not too bad either.
5, I went to Costco to get a 12 pack of tamales that averaged in price to a dollar and a quarter.  They had pork, cheese, and chicken.  I wanted shredded beef but apparently they don't carry it.  I settled for the chicken.  While there I had my glasses adjusted and cleaned by a very nice lady.  My experience until then had been pleasant.  Being disabled, I was using the shopping cart to brace myself.  I had only the package of tamales.  On my way out the exit, the checker looked at what I had in the cart and with a little smirk said "you should have gotten a bigger cart".  She dashed my pleasant experience at Costco and for the remainder of the afternoon.
3, Great place to purchase items for a medium sized family. Fairly cheap prices makes me keep coming back. Other than that it does have very long checkout lines and no self checkout. Which means no quick shopping runs, it's all or nothing.
5, Love Costco. Pharmacies great too. Their medication is better quality than most places and they are honest. Hard to find in many places.  The store carries items at such better prices than regular stores and carries a great organic selection. Plus the samples are great. You can get ideas from workers and taste what you are buying b4 you buy it. So refreshing. Its definitely a one stop shop .
5, This is one of the Best Costco locations I have shopped at. The Gasoline lines move rather quickly and the parking is always open and available. I usually arrive around 9:40 A.M. to fuel up and then I am one of the first customers when the front doors open. The store layout and lighting are great with several associates working to help you. The prices and selections are very competitive, and the Samples in the later hours are a great opportunity to see if you like or dislike a product. The checkout process moves along quickly and I enjoy chatting with the associates who always offer me Boxes for my items and help out if needed. I am very thankful to have this location and look forward to checking out the New Costco location coming soon in Santa Maria.

5, Great place.Opened a register when more people where in line..Very helpful with app to get twenty percent off.
4, Very helpful staff. They were able to answer all our questions completely. Very good discount structure.
5, I was looking for a particular item. The sales associate went out of his way to check the back, bring up that sort of item on his computer screen and was very helpful with information. I worked retail for years and know great customer service when I see it. This guy had it.

[The experience here has been great!  The kids are happy and love the coaches.
5, I have been a gymnast here for 12 years, competing all the way from Level 4 to Level 10 competitive boys team gymnastics. I received a lifetime of experiences and memories in this gym. Highly recommended, staff well trained, office professional and overall a happy place to be--Let's go CCG.
5, I've been here once. I feel like the bad reviews are unwarranted. A mistake or one bad employee doesn't constitute a 1 star. Let's not forget that mistakes happen. I'll be enrolling my boys this month. I've heard lots of good things about this place.
5, Love this place! My kid has been going to CCG for 8 months. The coaches are great! Overall gymnastics is a great activity for children, and there's no other place I'd want my son to go. 
5, Unprofessional and inexperienced coaches. Problems with the office staff from the beginning. Wouldn't recommend this gym to anyone.

[Starting training with MZR fitness has been the best decision, regarding health and fitness I have ever made!   Mike's  knowledge and expertise  is priceless. BEST IN SLO
5, MZR Fitness is the place to be. Just down the street from in San Luis Obispo. If you want to get a great work out, be around fun people, and be in a great atmosphere, MZR Fitness is for you. The owner, Mike Robinson provides and creates fun and challenging workouts that fit my and your needs and goals. Not only does he design the workout for you, but his encouragement and motivation helps you want to take to that victory lap. My workouts with Mike have been such a help! I'd recommend MZR Fitness and Mike Robinson to anyone! I'll be sticking around, that's for sure!‎
5, MZR Fitness Facility is packed full of new, innovative work out equipment that makes getting in shape exciting.For the past couple of years, Mike has helped me maintain a consistent workout routine as well as a healthy lifestyle. At MZR Fitness, my workouts are more effective then ever in a new, friendly, and clean environment. Mike constantly challenges me with new and creative exercises which makes training even more fun.Thanks Mike, and congrats on the new gym, it rocks!
5, MZR Fitness is a new and unique kind of gym that really makes working out a lot of fun for me. I really enjoy the different workout equipment and workouts that Mike has had me do so far. The friendly personal attention that I get here is great, and is one of the reasons why I choose MZR Fitness over the other gyms around town.
5, I've been working out at MZR Fitness for almost 4 months now and I absolutely love it. I promised them at MZR Fitness that when I hit my short term goal of losing 20 lbs, that I would write a review online for them so I here I am because I just hit my target yesterday. As cliche' as it sounds to say this, it really is the truth that I could not have done it without the help of MZR Fitness. These guys there really know their stuff especially Mike. I've just never been around so much positive & motivating energy in a gym before. They held me accountable every step of the way and I just love coming there and I look forward to it every single workout. And lastly, I debated on whether I should address one of the previously posted messages by "sportymeg5 " but I can't help it and I have to say something. All that I'm going to say is that I think that whomever this person was should keep their negative comments to themselves. If you don't have anything nice to say, then dont say anything. Furthermore, it makes me believe that it was one of the other gyms here in town that wrote that message or just somebody who doesn't know exactly what is going on at this gym. So yes when you say that you "wouldn't go back", you really are doing everybody a favor. Everyone that I know who goes to MZR Fitness loves it and we don't want that kind of negativity on the premises.

[The gym is located in a tucked away corner off a main street.  It's a good size including one gym for the regular members and one gym for the competition team and olympic lifting.  The front office is quaint and the lounge is kid friendly with plenty seats to hang out in while waiting to get into a class.Bill Grundler, the owner, is attentive to all the athletes and we were no different.  He made sure we felt welcomed and during the workout we performed all our movements correctly. One tip.  Some of the members we encountered were a little stand off-ish at first, but once we broke through the tough exterior, then they were ok.  If you're in the area though, this would a place to drop in.
4, Love this place... great coaching, great atmosphere
5, My favorite place in the whole world!! Highly recommend.
5, I have been a member of the Inferno for a little over a year now and my absolute favorite part of the experince has been the trainers and members.  I often find that I don't want to go home after the workout and end up staying talking to all of my new friends!  Everyone has been open and welcoming, the trainers are skilled and passionate, and the classes are second to none. Everyone participates in the trainer led workouts - young, old, albe, not so able.  Loads and movements are appropriately scaled and/or modified so that everyone does a very similar workout.  The workouts themselves are constantly varied so there is never a sense of burning out on a particular routine, because we don't have one!It seems like every day someone bests a previous record, experiences a 'first', or just plain does something they never thought possible.  A truly amazing community, and an truly amazing workout. You'll leave with a tired body, energized mind, and the desire to do it all over again tomorrow!

[I've been to a lot of yoga studios around the area and there is something special about Spark.  The instructors are fabulous and the ambience really puts me in the right head and heart space to further my practice.  I love it!  Signed up for a membership in this new year.
5, I had never done yoga before.  I love Spark's variety of classes especially that the first class is 6:15am so I can go before work!  It's a total body work out with Sculpt and Barre and I am stronger because of the wonderful teachers. I've been going for nearly 3 years.  It's clean and I'm so excited about the expansion. Love. Love.
5, I like being greeted by people who know my name.  When I walk in I feel like a long lost family member who has just returned from a great journey, welcomed home, seen and appreciated.  It means a lot, thanks for creating this!!
5, Spark is a great little yoga space in SLO.  I like the hour long class lengths, class style variety, and plethora of equipment.  As someone who has been taking wellness classes around SLO for 15 years, and taught them around the community for 10 years, I love what this space is up to and look forward to seeing how they continue to evolve!  Thanks for doing what you do, Spark! Some very specific personal preferences:  The heat gets overwhelming for me sometimes.  The classes can be so fast paced and loud that I can't hear what the next move is and by the time I figure it out the instructor has moved on.  I wouldn't expect the studio to change those things though, they seem to be part of the vibe and most students seem to love those parts of the classes so it's likely just me :)
5, The most enjoyable experience I have ever had. It hit on all the sense. I will definitely be back on a regular basis!

[The breadth and depth.  I love the different yoga modalities that I am able to experience in a day.  So, the diversity of styles and teachers is key.  Plus, there is a depth that each teacher brings to their class which is on a level that I had previously not experienced from other yoga classes.  I have learned more about myself and the practices of yoga, breathing, grounded centeredness that all my previous yoga experience prior, which spans like 20 years +.  For this I am truly, deeply grateful!  The experience has open my eyes and my heart to new forms of practice and ways of being that I had not previously considered.  I am inspired to enroll in the Teacher Training program - It's just a matter of when.  My yoga practice returned as a way of dealing with a seriously tragic medical journey.  I had two brain surgeries, followed by a back surgery.  Yoga has allowed my body, heart, and soul to continue recovering and I have regained much of the holistic strength that has been lost...!!!
5, The classes are great, the instructors are knowledgable and caring, and the space is welcoming regardless of ability/skill level.
5,  peaceful environment and great kitchen:-)
5, Wonderful teachers, and the studio is very inviting.

[this gym is never too crowded and the staff is friendly. Frank, who I presume the owner, is always happy to help and give tips. most reviews on here seem to reflect negatively on the cancellation fees and renovation fees charged November. if you read the contract this is all outlined! people leaving bad ratings because they are too dull to read a contract they sign whilst signing up for the gym.
5, I work out here almost every day. I would give it 5 stars, but they don't have a deadlift platform and bumper plates aren't quite the same.
4, I have had the best experience with Club 24. This the the first time a gym has felt like a community to me and actually motivated me to go. The trainers and staff are wonderful and take the time to learn your name and help you if a machine is confusing or you are doing a movement in a way that could get your hurt, even if you don't go for personal training!The remodel is all state of the art equipment and the whole gym looks chic and modern for a very reasonable monthly price. It also pretty amazing that you can take all the classes on just a regular membership! I'm recommend this gym to people all the time!
5, I called Club 24 today 8/13 1:30pm) and I asked if I could buy a membership so that I could come and take showers for a couple of days. My Father is in Hospice and I've been staying with him 24 hours a day.  I asked if I could buy day passes. The girl on the phone told me that I could NOT do that because I wasn't going to work out...couldn't make this up if I tried! I asked if they offered a monthly pass (even though my Father might not make it through the night). She told me that it was $99.00, but that she would "get in trouble" for selling me one because I wasn't going to work out. I asked to speak to a Manager and she put me on hold until I finally hung up. This is THE WORST BUSINESS that I have ever encountered. Hopefully this review is read BEFORE you spend a dime at this facility. This is absolutely unconscionable.
1, I love club 24. The employees are very nice and the gym is always clean. It's never really too crowded to the point where it affects my workout. I have never had to wait for a machine and they are also new as well. Come join.!

[Have been going to this gym for many years - super friendly staff and instructors!  The cardio classes are great, and everyone is made to feel welcome.
5, I went to this gym last year but had to drop it because of school. Now that it's summer I'm back at it again! I feel super comfortable while working out, and I never have to stay waiting for the equipments. The classes are definitely great workout and they're fun! Over all the staffs are great :D!
5, I've been going to Equilibrium for years and have always loved the upbeat and friendly vibe. The classes are great work outs and you can always find an open machine or free weights on the floor. All of the instructors, trainers and staff are very friendly and motivating and will help you reach any goals you have. I've been dealing with an injury for quite a long time and my trainer has helped me modify exercises to accommodate my limitations as well as given me endless support to help me reach my goals. I love going to EQ to get a great workout, but on top of that, I love it because the staff and the regulars are just genuinely happy to see you. It's a fun place to be and that makes workouts a little easier to get through! I never want to move from SLO because I know I'll never find another gym like Equilibrium, it really is a gem!
5, I was very impressed by this women-only gym in SLO.  I needed a day pass for a workout since I was visiting my son for the weekend.  The staff was friendly and helpful and I could tell the clientele enjoyed being there - lots of laughter and camaraderie.  The pleasant ambiance and equipment selection will bring me back again on another visit.  
4, I've been going here for years and absolutely love it.  Most of the instructors are great and they keep the tempo quick and upbeat.  The fact that this is a women only gym keeps me coming back because I always feel comfortable with the staff and all the regulars.  It can get a little busy at times when school is in and the place gets flooded with the college girls.  But that only lasts for a short while and before you know it the classes are back to normal.

[I recently visited the area for 2 weeks and trained with Chris at both his Paragon SLO and Atascadero locations. He and his students were very welcoming. His SLO location has a large mat area, boxing ring, heavy bags, weight area, and several changing rooms. Chris's teaching was excellent! I enjoyed his instruction and rolling with numerous talented people.His Atascadero location is brand-new and connected to a large gym with all kinds of amenities. If you are in either area, I would highly recommend Paragon Jiu Jitsu!
5, Awesome Jiu Jitsu training going on here!! I'm a woman and found it accepting and comfortable. My husband and I were able to train our butts off during our mini vacation! Chris and Mallory are very kind, their students are inviting, and their gym is clean and roomy. Definitely would visit again!!
5, I'm a beginner Gracie Jiu Jitsu student from Kansas, was in the area vacationing, and decided to stop in and see what Paragon was all about. Great gym! No egos! Everyone was welcoming, and I had a great time!  
5, While in SLO visiting the wife's family, Chris at Paragon BJJ was kind enough to allow me to drop in for a class. The warm up, techniques, and rolling sessions were all intense, and a great experience. Each of the guys I practiced/rolled with was inviting and kind, despite that I was the outsider for the day. Chris- you and your students are welcome to visit us near Boston at Kimura BJJ (Tewksbury MA) anytime! Thanks again!
5, Sweet academy with awesome folks. I popped in while visiting the area, no egos. Just old school jiujitsu.

5, Beautiful wares, lovely inspiration and culture of ladies running the store, high quality leather and beautiful fabrics, perfect prices
5, I found the cutest pair of Frye boots here and the ladies running the store were nice to talk to
5, Totally in love with this place. Lots of rad, vintage finds and the ladies who run the shop are super sweet.

[I love this gym so much. There's an amazing variety of classes focusing on strength, endurance, and/or cardio that can be as challenging or as low key as you want to get out of them. And a lot of them mix in fun too. Instructors who help you achieve your goals. Affordable membership AND really affordable kid care. Showers and locker rooms too! The staff is super friendly and helpful. I didn't think I'd ever be a gym person until I found this one and am so grateful!
5, Overall it's a great gym. Gene is awesome I would highly recommend getting your membership through him in slo. Only downside is the basketball court floor really needs a cleaning and to be dusted regularly.
4, This is the cleanest gym ever. Nice people at the front desk. Basketball court, swimming pool etc. All fun activities
5, I really like the well-rounded aspect of this gym with a pool full workout area and basketball court. They just need bigger flat screen TVs in front of the treadmills and ellipticals
4, Best workout facility in town! Extremely competent staff and services! A special thanks to the owners and management that run the Kennedy club for making this place what it is. I will definitely be recommending to friends and family.

[Gym facilities are clean, and the equipment has a newer feel to it.  I liked working out here, and the classes were ok, but they were often cancelled because of lack of attendance.  What really displeased me was cancelling my membership.  I had a year-long contract, and I stayed at the gym for the whole year.  When the contract expired, I thought my membership would end, but it didn't; I was moved to a month-to-month membership.  That was my fault for not reading the fine print on the contract, and I was ok with that.  What really upset me was that in order to end the month-to-month membership, I had to pay a 30 dollar cancellation fee, in addition to one additional month.  So what's my reward for sticking out the year long contract?  A nice 50 dollar charge parting gift.  Thanks.  Why is everyone and their brother out to get your money...?
2, Has the equipment you need for a basic workout, along with a floor...  As far as a full gym, there is no pool, hot tub, sauna, decent locker rooms.

[I've been at Athlon for two months now and I've got to say that the trainers are awesome. Everyone on staff is fun to be around, approachable, and most importantly, educated. I've been feeling stronger and better than I have in awhile, and on top of that I can feel old injuries finally starting to heal up. I highly recommend you try Athlon out for yourself!
5, So I've been going to Athlon for 2 months now and love it.  The trainers are fun people but goal focused.  I love that each work out is challenging and touches on both strength and cardio.  Looking forward to a long future with this gym.  Give it a shot, all levels of fitness are welcomed and embraced.
5, Athlon, in my opinion, is the ideal gym for people of all different fitness levels. As a professional athlete I can honestly say Athlon and its coaches have provided me with the best environment I have ever worked out in. I entrusted them with my career and have reaped the rewards. I have never been as strong or moved as well as I am now thanks to the coaches at Athlon. My balance, vision and overall coordination have improved by leaps and bounds as well. The knowledge I have gained about how my body works and how to properly take care of it is invaluable. From Ryan, to Cory, to Angela, to Jasmine and Andy, every coach that I have worked with has gone above and beyond to help me reach my goals.
5, I've been a member at Athlon for over year now and it's hands down the best gym I've ever held a membership at! It has all the equipment I was looking for without all the extra "fluff" you get a bigger fitness clubs. While I haven't taken any of their group training/personal training sessions, from what I've seen the trainers at Athlon are extremely knowledgeable & passionate about helping folks reach their fitness goals. I'd totally recommend this place if you're looking for a great gym in SLO.
5, The Athlon workouts are great.  Jasmine kicks ass.  I've been going for a few months and feel much healthier (started to sweat less when walking around or dancing, feel stronger, and am generally in a better mood).  The classes are paced well, challenging but not overly so if you're a beginner.  Do it!

[I am a frequent lulu shopper and knew exactly what I was looking for before entering the store, but if I was not a return customer then I would not have purchased any items from this store. The staff was not helpful what so ever. No one greeted me walking in, no one offered me a fitting room, I had to ask for one to be set up, she didn't even ask my name or change it on the room from the person before me. She never asked how I was doing or if I needed another size. Extremely different experience than I have ever had in any other lululemon store. I would rate their customer service a zero. No one asked what I was looking for or any type of assistance at all. I also watched a man looking for about 30 minutes right next to an associate before she offered to help him. 
2, New store, with excellent and friendly staff.  I've never been to one of these stores before they came to SLO, but apparently they offer clothes that are very exercise friendly and breathable but still suitable for a casual work environment.  This way if you bike to work or workout in the middle of the day, you can wear these clothes and still be comfortable.
5, Love your guys athletic wear, the best.

1, My girls loved it! 
5, I was not very happy with the teachers. They were nice enough, but there was not very much one on one time and almost the entire class was just them showing a routine once and then the kids were on their own. There was also usually at least 15 minutes of warming up. A bit much for 5 years olds. They also sat and talked about nothing for the last 5-10 minutes of the class with the kids. I went for one month and then stopped. I also got charged for an extra class because I didn't give them two weeks notice.
2, I went for a birthday party for a friend and all the teachers where nice and I've been begging my parents to let me go ever since😜👍

[After herniating a disk in my lower lumbar I started taking Pilates.  If I take at least once a week my back does not hurt or reinjure.  Nikole is an excellent Pilates instructor and the studio has a welcoming positive vibe.  Clearly the first reviewer is a competitor or bitter hater.
5, I wake up every Thursday morning thinking about how good my body is going to feel after I go to class that night. The exercises are tailored to your body size and strength. Nikole is an amazing instructor with a great attitude and an awesome sense of humor. I couldn't be happier with my experience at this studio!
5, I could not disagree with Jim more!!  I don't usually write reviews, but this was necessary to set the record straight!  I have had amazing results attending the Pilates reformer group classes at Balance and have been attending for over 10 years.  I have also had instruction at a very reputable school in the pilates industry and I can assure you that what is taught at Balance is DEFINITELY Pilates!  If you are serious and willing to do the work necessary to learning Pilates then this is the place for you!!
5, This studio doesn't teach Pilates. It teaches some variation that doesn't provide results and injures people. Don't bother!

[I was traveling through SLO for a couple of days and found SLO Yoga Center online. I took Terry's Yin Yoga class. First time here, and first time doing Yin. Absolutely loved my experience here. Stephanie at the front desk was very warm, welcoming, and helpful. Terry is one of the best yoga teachers I've ever had (I've been doing different types of yoga for about 20 years). His gentle, yet clear approach made it easy to follow and focused my practice in a very deep way. Great modifications and attention to detail. Really good vibes in this studio. Keep up the great work! If I'm ever back through SLO, I will definitely be back!
5, Super friendly & fun staff.  New location and they are always making improvements to keep their practice fresh and flowing.
5, I love this place! I am an older, intermediate student, and I have taken classes from nearly every teacher. Each teacher has something unique and wonderful to offer. I thought the fact that many of them are young would mean they might not "know" as much. I am humbled and honored to have this beautiful group of people lead me deeper into my practice of yoga. 
5, I like the Yin and restorative offerings; Katy is wonderful, as are most of the teachers.  When I had a question on the membership I asked, and it was quickly resolved to my full satisfaction.  Travis is right, it has a very big schedule and diverse range of classes and the space is growing which they needed.  What I like best is the flavor of the place; Jenn and Travis, Rocky, Kiyoko, Hanna, and so many more great spirits . . . it is a pleasure to practice here.  Bring us Sarah Powers . . . please?  Visiting Yogi's are always a treat!
5, New owners. $20 drop-ins. They pressure you to purchase a membership. Even called me at home. The instructors are all young and with very limited experience. Many of them straight out of yoga teacher training. It is not my cup of tea but it may be yours.

Great patterns and colors. They have a whole craft section and seasonal items. Upstairs there is a sale section. I come here each time I am in town. Bring your own bag, though and no American Express.
5, Its a good craft store they have everything I ever need. They have a clearance section upstairs where you can find some great stuff and the staff is also very nice!! The only thing I didn't like was that the fabric seems a little over priced compared to other fabric stores.

[After finally getting this welcoming library it's rightfully needed upgrades to it's new open and fresh layout.  When you enter into the bright and open entrance you don't get that depressing grandma's old retro basement vibe the building once had.  The new design gives the place a nice cohesive flow in the way it operates.  The automated drop off slot is fun to use and watch how it sorts everything to it's appropriate box. The media lab/area is finally where it should have been all along, with the second and third floors department relocations making more sense.

4, October 29th, 2008 --  BELLE CHASSE, La. - Just two days before Halloween, "Batman" dropped in for a special visit with 159th Fighter Wing Operations Group and Maintenance Squadron for an exciting adventure. Last October, Rivers Lacrouts received a warm welcome as he and his mother, Bridget Simpson, visited the Fighter Wing, part of the Fighter Pilot For a Day program. Similar to the "Make a Wish Foundation," coordination for the event began as early as spring 2008, where a base effort was put together to ensure he saw what real pilots do. Lt. Col. Sostarics, commander of the 122nd Fighter Squadron, and his family has known Rivers and his mother, for more than four years through his wife's , Nicole, workplace.

[Good spot for drinks after work. Not as busy as places downtown, and there parking. Selection is pretty good for beer (lots of local places), and a lot of local wine
4, Dog friendly, wheel chair friendly, just plain friendly! We used this place for an annual gathering of friends before the holidays and it worked out perfectly
5, Great spot to meet with friends and grab a glass of wine. It can get a bit noisy when busy but it has never been a problem.

[The best thing about the San Luis Obispo County Law Library is the staff. All of them are so helpful, and are always willing to point you in the right direction. The library is quite small compared to other counties, but I haven't had a problem finding what I need, and they have computers linked to subscription databases that can pull up a lot of information not in the stacks. If you need a bigger selection, go to Santa Maria (Santa Barbara County), but if what you're looking for isn't obscure, I'd try San Luis Obispo first and talk to the staff about what you're trying to find.

5, Nice library but I was there during spring break when students were gone, got a nice quiet table with a decent chair on the 5th floor. That's where my photo was taken. Probably gets very busy and despite all the upvotes on the coffeeshop in the library there is a Starbucks nearby in the overpriced market.

[October 29th, 2008 --  BELLE CHASSE, La. - Just two days before Halloween, "Batman" dropped in for a special visit with 159th Fighter Wing Operations Group and Maintenance Squadron for an exciting adventure. Last October, Rivers Lacrouts received a warm welcome as he and his mother, Bridget Simpson, visited the Fighter Wing, part of the Fighter Pilot For a Day program. Similar to the "Make a Wish Foundation," coordination for the event began as early as spring 2008, where a base effort was put together to ensure he saw what real pilots do. Lt. Col. Sostarics, commander of the 122nd Fighter Squadron, and his family has known Rivers and his mother, for more than four years through his wife's , Nicole, workplace. Sostarics said the event is usually coordinated around operation group missions to allow for a full tour of the jets preparation and execution process. "It's where you get to treat them to a special day," said Sostarics. Rivers was diagnosed with Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy at nine-months-old.

5, Smart, informed, insightful, friendly and really good wine! Highly recommend!
5, Love this place, great selection of non-local wines and very friendly staff. Only wish there was more comfy, lower profile seating.
4, Love this venue--and the owners and staff are great.  It's a fun place for a party--or go to one of the wine-centric events they put on every week.

[Came here for lunch with a BOGO entre offer. Grad burger is tasty charbroiled flavor. Love the fact that you can pick your own toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, onion, etc.) from a cart on the side of the pick up window. This allowed me to put exactly how much of what I wanted on the burger. Price is about average for a 1/2 pound burger. Overall good experience. Beer choice is good and offers a full bar since doubles as a nightclub in the evening. Might just be back to try that out.
4, Totally cool place to go for lunch or dinner or just hang out & grab a 'cold one'!! (Have your "D/D") with you if ur planning on having more than 2 'drinks'! They have "great food" & good prices!
4, I've been to the grad for various occasions... Security and operational staff are always respectful and on their game.  Bartenders a bit salty but never rude...damn they can pour a fierce drink though!
4, This place was ok. We walked in around 3pm and it had a wired feeling because it was dead and a really open place. It ended being clean and staff and friendly. A really awesome plus was that that they had a condiment bar for your food. So you can add lettuce, tomato, onion, and what ever else you like to your food. Beer was really reasonable priced. Food was ok priced. I don't know if I would pay that much again for what we got. I got a chicken avocado club. A thick piece of grilled chicken was grilled nicely with flavor. Got like a half of avocado with nice really crispy bacon. Lots of fries that were ok and unsalted which was nice in my opinion. Overall I would like to see this place during the popping times.
4, Walked into country night (Thursday nights). Little bit different than I imagined, lots of people dressed in cowboy hats and boots that line dance to not only country music, but rap and pop too. If you not a line dancer and you are looking to dance, stay clear of "country nights". Definitely not your Midwest country music night!

[Absolutely incredible. I don't exaggerate when I say that these are the greatest wings I've ever tasted in my entire life. The chicken is succulent and comes off the bone just right and the seasoning is just to die for. Come here and get ready for an experience.
5, I wish that they'd specify the wings were dry rub instead of sauce which i was thinking they would be. went in on tuesday at about 9:30, and they had told me the wait time would be about 17 minutes when i was the only one there (sounded unbelievable to me). though they were just over estimating just so that no one would complain about the time if it took longer. i also found out that the sauces such as ranch and blue cheese cost $1 each. really, a $1 for sauce where most other places give them out free?
2, I've eaten here a couple times.  My problem is not with the food, the food is fine, my problem is with the staff shutting the place down early.  You've literally got a BIG neon sign in the window that's boasting "OPEN TIL' MIDNIGHT"  and last Saturday night, I was there at 11:35 and refused service. So this Saturday night at 11:20pm  I just got out of a recording session, hungry as all get-out, I tried calling my order ahead twice.  Both times it went to voicemail.  So I drove over, parked out front and when I came to the counter at 11:35PM the guy looked at me and said they just took the last order for the night.  Really?  C'mon.  I called twice.I've encountered this a few times now enough to write this.   Now I have all due sympathy to work staff not wanting to get slammed right before closing and I'm always very gracious in those situations.  If a tip option is given, I go 20 to 25%.  I've worked in restaurants, I get it,  but if you don't want to be open until midnight, don't advertise it.   This wingstop is located on one of the busiest corners of a college town that is known to be out late.  It wasn't as though it was a slow night.      I often play gigs that go from 9pm to 12am and at 11:20, I don't get up on the mic and say "Sorry guys, I'm going to stop it here because I'm scheduled to 12am and I want to start packing up my equipment so I can get home on time."   Do you know how quickly I'd be fired?  I play my set as posted and then when the place closes I break down my gear.  That's the job I'm hired to do and the job the staff at wing stop is hired to do.If you want to be open until 11:30, I'm fine with that, but don't refuse customers a good 25minutes before closing.  Seriously, get your fast food chain restaurant out of this town if you're not going to play by the same rules the locals do.  We don't need you here.
1, If I could I would give this place no stars, the service is snail paced slow...
1, The wings always taste hella burnt

3, Amazing, I had their Tri-Tip salad most places you in my get a little meat. This was THE BEST Tri Tip salad I ever had👍👍. I can't believe I've never eaten here before. We need one in Paso
5, Took 45mins for a order I called to go. When I arrived to pick up order they forgot to make my beach balls. So after waiting I got my order when I went to eat my sandwich it was already cold. Guess it was my fault for ordering to go. Employees didn't seem to care at all.
2, Best food in SLO. We frequent here readily as the portions are large and consistently delicious. Beef ribs are amazing. Pretty much everything we have ordered is perfect, savory and cooked to perfection!.. Generous slice of carrot cake for desert!....so save room!
5, Great flavors, meats and sides. Out shines most local bbq places. Going to try the one in Grover Beach for comparison

[This is a wonderful Italian Restaurant and Pizza Place. We had pizza and salads here. The salad we had was an antipasto salad and it was the most absolutely amazing Pizza salad I think I've ever had. The pizza was exceptional and reasonably priced. They have remodeled the place since it became Gino's and it is lovely inside. It's a casual family friendly type place and has a little game room.
5, I ordered the calzone and it was very good.  Margherita style add pepperoni.. next time I would say easy on the tomato though...
5, We had a delicious medium pizza with lots of veggies. Fun place with great service and a gameroom. We played air hockey! Will have to try the calzone next time.

3, Make your own sandwich place. Pretty good sandwiches. Lots of option including hot/flat/cold/size/ingredients. Sometimes I'm not sure why the wait's long.

[The perfect place for a first date, night out or just a nice family night. With comfortable seats, wide isles and most of the rows containing reclining chairs... It's a great experience. Decent wine selection and ability to salt and butter your own popcorn is a nice addition as well. Not to mention you can reserve your seating through their website or app (which takes you to their mobile website),  so you don't need to worry about getting there an hour early for a good/new movie.
5, I was in town over Thanksgiving weekend and believe it or not, saw 3 movies here in 3 days. The ticket prices were way cheaper than mega cinemas I usually go to back home. The food choices were awesome. I think I saw some one with beer. Popcorn was fresh. And the bathrooms were clean. Can't ask for more than that.
5, This is our favorite theater right now. The lay down recliners are amazing. Book early because they sell out. You can get beer or wine and take it into any theater. I also love the soda machine with like 200 possible combinations.
4, They've definitely improved this place a lot. The new seating is great, even if you can't get a recliner the rockers are nice. They've added wine and beer. It's pricey, but still nice to have. They have a few more food options like pretzels (which I love) hopefully they'll add some more food soon. I'd recommend buying your tickets online especially for a newer movie. It's convenient and the good seats fill up early.
4, This place is fantastic! Employees all seem to like working there. The seats in the theatres are super comfortable! We always plan ahead so we can use the recliners!  Perfect for a date night or for taking your family to a show! Going there really makes "the movie experience" a better one!

[Love Mother's. Great drinks and always a great time!
5, Had a weird experience at this bar, visiting town with my sisters and we presented our IDs but the bartender was flabbergasted. He looked them over and then disappeared with our IDs to a back room...never had this happen at a bar ever. When he returned with our IDs he tried to joke unsuccessfully about them possibly being fake IDs because they all had the same last name(??)... after basically accusing us of using fake IDs. He handled the situation extremely poorly and definitely did not make us feel welcome or apologize for the accusations...so we ordered one drink and then wished we hadn't since we were totally ignored once we ordered so off we went...
1, Nice atmosphere, great place to enjoy the farmer's market food and still eat with the comforts of a restaurant. Tri tip was wonderful. 
5, Nice Place for Late Lunch and a PintWe came here in the later afternoon for a late lunch. Ordered the fish and chips at $14.95 each; they're delicious! Also had a pint of the IPA: wonderful stuff. It wasn't crowded when we went so we found the ambience quite chill. Friendly wait staff. 
4, One of the go-to night spots in SLO if you want to party with the college aged crowd.  Get there early if you don't want to pay cover.  Drinks are expensive (as compared to some other places in town) so don't be surprised.  The place gets pretty messy as the night goes on and dancing usually starts on the main floor, as disastrous as it is.

5, Always so amazing but my favorite is the chicken dinner special. Definitely order the chicken. Oh and they pull an excellent espresso shot, too. 
5, Steve and Dwyne have a fabulous selection of yummies here. Don't miss it!
5, Everything here is so good! Soups, deli salads, sandwiches, etc. My favorites are their daily meat specials (brisket, porchetta), rotisserie chicken, and their quiche is fantastic!!
5, Nice friendly staff, cute location and most importantly wonderful food! I usually get mine to go and it's like having a meal cooked just for me. They also have some wonderful local goods, yes cocktail is a must try.

5, This place genuinely impressed me. I was surprised at how good the pizza was. The dough is extremely tasty and they have great calzones as well. The staff was very friendly. Definitely recommend. 
5, Simply the best pizza in town.  Nothing too crazy, just quality ingredients and a great dough.
5, Awesome pizza. They even have a good gluten free crust.

[I was extremely excited to order Pizza Solo for an office lunch after having it at Farmers Market.  Pizza Solo is my go to meal when I attend Farmers.My initial interaction was good, I called the night before my work event and the gentleman on the phone was very polite.  He instructed me that it would be best to call back in the morning.  Because they don't open until 11am and it was a large order that would need to be delivered by 12pm I was concerned about not ordering the night before.  He reassured me that he would be in early the next day at 10am to take my order.I called 4 times the next morning starting at 10am, no answer.  At 10:45 I was finally forced to place my order with another restaurant to ensure I had food for my meeting.
2, Tasty pizza! I ordered a large Thai Pie and split it with my fiance. We both had 4 slices and it ended up being pretty filling. I'm not usually a fan of thin pizza because they sometimes don't fill me up, but this one did the trick and i really liked the crust. Not too bad for $15, I recommend it.
4, Great pizza place downtown. Outdoor sitting lets you people watch while you have good pizza. I've been coming here for over 10 years and I highly recommend it!
5, Bought a pepperoni pizza. The Solo size. Spent about 9 bucks. The marinara sauce was wattery. The cheese and pepperoni were sliding off the pizza. If you enjoy holding down the toppings on your slice or holding your slice like a taco so everything stays, this might be the place for you. Otherwise just get one of their overpriced salads or go elsewhere for pizza.
1, Crust tasted like actual cardboard . Not exaggerating.. and cheese fell off completly . It is pretty cheap but the sizes are off

[Food was good. Service was awesome, and staff were friendly, but many tables had food crumbs and needed to be cleaned. 
4, I went to the round table and slow today for lunch pretty good food but the only thing I don't like was there is no names of the pizzas like the King Arthur Hawaiian pepperoni there was no names it's just put on the buffets  plus their iced tea was hot and nasty
3, Great food, we order regularly on Saturdays. But not open til 10 on Fridays as advertised online. They actually close at 9.
4, I love round table pizza. I went to the San Luis Obispo restaurant for the first time and brought my wife there too. She had never had a Round Table pizza before and I wanted her to try it. We went for the lunch special. We both put lots of Parmesan cheese on top of our pizzas and the pizza was pretty good. Just as I had finished, my wife noticed a black  bug that was about a half inch to an inch long inside the Parmesan cheese shaker. The bug was alive and pretty active in the cheese. I took the shaker to the manager and she said it was pretty disgusting. My wife didn't want to finish the last slice of her pizza and I didn't want it either after what I saw.  The manager said it was a "pincher" bug and they were all over San Luis. She said they sprayed every month but the area was infested with them. I kept wondering if they lay eggs in the cheese that we liberally  sprinkle out over the pizzas. It could have happened to any restaurant I suppose, but it left a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively that is).
1, It is what it is...Round Table. Nice employees and clean restaurant.

[We were staying for the holiday weekend and were craving Italian food. We found this restaurant through Yelp and were s bit disappointed. The garlic knots were dry and the spaghetti sauce to acidic. The linguine with shrimp and pesto was too salty. What I do recommend is the beet salad and chicken lasagna with pesto beschamel sauce. Both dishes were hands down delicious!!  Service was wonderful too!!
3, Everything was fresh, tasty, and timely. Our waitress, Angela, was great and the environment was too. Everything was very clean as well with a pleasant ambiance. The servings are not large, but not too small either. Overall a great experience.
5, Best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had!  Attentive wait staff and great atmosphere.  We'll definitely go back!
5, This is my wife and I's first date spot, and it's where we went for our first dinner as newlyweds. It has always been our "go to" spot. Great food, warm atmosphere, polite knowledgeable staff and a modest bill at the end of the night are a winning formula for one of the best restaurants in SLO!
5, Great food. Very friendly service. Everyone worked together to make our night wonderful. Thanks!!! I saw another review that marked this restaurant down because they couldn't  find parking. Sad to say some people just need drive there Hyundai to Taco Bell and keep eating there. Never come into SLO town.

[The last of its kind! We always have an amazing time here the entrance fee for two movies is ridiculously low. The concession stand is Affordable and staff is very helpful.
5, This has been a favorite since my childhood and I'm also glad it's still open since they are so rare these days. Used to be one price per car, now it's priced per person. Kids movie always plays first, and the more adult movie plays second, with about a 20 minute intermission. Small concession stand with snacks, and restrooms.
5, Loved it! Delicious nachos! And real butter on their popcorn! Plus they have a really cute girl making them!
5, Great drive-in to see new release movies. Great food and service. Always nice.
5, 2 movies, 9.00 an adult, no one talking behind you, whats not to love at the Drive-in. We go at least once a month, sometimes more during the summer blockbuster movie run. Grounds are kept clean.  Snack bar offers some common yummy snacks like popcorn, soda, candy, and nachos. Love their nachos! Good prices and free refills on popcorn and drinks. Family owned and operated, family friendly, never had a problem. Free jumps at the end of the night if your battery should die. Radios to rent if you don't have one. Screen large and picture quality good. Minor complaints, bathrooms need upgrading and once in awhile you'll smell pot, but other then that, love going their with my family.

[I visited on 2/2/18. The food was hot and fresh and the service was friendly. Be aware that it can get a little busy around the lunch time and there may be a line. Over all Good experience I’ll be back.
4, This location is always great. They always have fresh food, and the service is very quick. They keep the dining room very clean as well.
5, This place gets too busy during lunch for only average food but worth stopping if the line isn't out the door!
4, My friends and I love traveling to Panda on the weekends for a quick meal. They always have for prepared and everything is quite clean. Sure it may not be as lovely as standard pandas but it is still a great place to hang out!
4, While the staff was extremely nice it was frustrating to know that the online order I placed still wasn't ready when I arrived when they stated it would be ready. To add insult to injury I got a smaller than normal portion of the item that caused the delay. Just frustrates me that instead of asking to wait 2-3 more minutes for a regular sized portion they pulled those pieces that were first done, shorted my order, all just to get me out of there 2 minutes faster (I already waited 15...17 minutes isn't that big of a difference)

[This place is great for two working parents. In about an hour and a half we make a freezer full of dinners for the month. We spend less money on groceries and eating out. 
5, Great concept. Very nice staff.
5, The statement that "My Husband is becoming a great cook", both terrifies me & makes me proud :)  I am sure that they can teach us more.Thanks!
5, Love love Dream dinners, Lauren is awesome and the fact that she will prepare and bring the dinners to our house is an added blessing to us.  The dinners are great and my husband is becoming a great cook.  Thanks again Lauren for these great meals.
5, I have been using Dream Dinners for over a year now. I love the convenience of being able to prepare meals, take them home and then cook them as needed. Perfect for busy couples who do not always have time to make an entire meal. I usually make a side veggie/salad and some other side (spuds, rice or pasta, ect) to go along with the meal. My fave meals: Pub Style Chicken, Parmesan Crusted Chicken, and Arroz Con Pollo. The only draw back is that meals with beef tend to be more expensive.

[i order all the time but other day my delivery driver came crying to my houuse because she forgot my drink,she kept offering to drive to 7/11 to buy me one i told her it was fine because she said she would tell them and i would ge ta soda or pizza on next delivery. and on my next delivery i asked and they said i would have had to complain the night of....
2, Odered the pizza at 6:15. Told me it was delivered at 7:05.  Called to speak to manager, Stephanie, she hung up on me because I complained.  Called back and spoke with her, this time she new not to say anything because I could be recording her.  DIdn't receive pizza until 8:05, cold.  Something needs to change
1, The food is good I’m not going to lie to be honest one of my favorites, but actually today I was looking with detail how the make the pizzas and the lady was not wearing gloves, the sleeves of her windbreaker was touching the pizza, she was rubbing her nose while making the pizza, and to top it off she went outside and smoked a cigarette without gloves so her fingers wouldn’t smell like tabacco, I ain’t going back there again!
2, I've never had an issue with this Domino's...the employees are friendly. Delivery drivers are on time. The pan pizzas are good, so is the cheesy bread.
5, This is the only pizza store that I found that worked on Christmas Day in San Luis Obispo. That's quite amazing! I highly value the wonderful employees in this pizzeria. The quality of food is great, and the wait is standard 15 minutes. You can also order delivery, but that may take around an hour depending on the day and the numbed of employees. What I was amazed to find out was that it works up to 3am! Definitely worth the five stars.👍

[Great when there's enough staff, otherwise it takes 20 minutes just to get your pizza assembled and another 10 to get it baked. Maybe the cashier will decide to count the cash in the register or sweep the floor when you are standing there waiting to pay, for 10 more minutes.  When it's not busy, they're out of sauces, cheese, toppings, and drinks. Seems like the employees have no clue what they're doing. I'd come here again only if I ordered ahead and the employees weren't slacking off. Total time to get pizza: 30 minutes
1, This is hands down the best tasting and most customizable pizza I have ever had. Fast and friendly service even when the restaurant is packed.
5, This is like Subway for Pizza! Its an awesome way to get the pizza you want with an affordable price point!  The staff are friendly and the food is delicious.  They have gluten free options. And a verity of toppings and sauce.  IF your into spending $30.00 bucks for your pizza this is not for you; but if you like to walk in with $10.00 bucks and walk out with a dollar in  your pocket and a pizza give it a shot! Warning!!!..its addictive!
5, Highly enjoyed this build your own pizza place! We had a fantastic conversation with the staff which resulted with us accidentally taking the wrong pizza. They fixed it up and sent me on my way with a coupon for a free pizza later. I highly recommend this place for a good pie !
5, Blaze is great if you go when it is not busy. Otherwise, the pizza's come out burnt, the line is slow and place is a mess. But for 8.00 you get a 12 inch personalized pizza with as much toppings as you can coax the employees into giving you. It is also a hit or miss weather they have the toppings you want. I went on Sunday and no chopped tomatoes, time before that, out of pesto sauce. The time before that my husbands pizza came out burnt. When he took it back to complain they made a big deal about remaking his pizza and told him he would have to go to the back of the line. However, someone else stepped in and moved him to the make line and remade the pizza. It seems like they have a high staff turn over rate. Every time I've gone in there, there are tons of employees but no faces I recognize from the time before. They are now carrying a new soda, which I love, made with cane sugar. So if you can avoid the crowd, get a your pizza without getting it burned, for 8 bucks it's not to bad to sit out on the patio and get some sunshine.

[Always quality in this chain, salads and soups are great as usual. Service was excellent and we enjoyed the experience here. Pleasant atmosphere was a plus for us and all rooms seemed welcoming.
4, The staff is actually great with wine pairings and helping you choose something based on a flavor or food restrictions!! GF options and good drink selections! Hardly ever a wait or line.
5, Food is usually good, lots of breadsticks and salad, service this time was good. It can get very loud. Drinks are good.
4, Jarred the bartender provided a phenomenal experience.  I have been to many different Olive Garden locations and this customer service surpassed my expectations.  Jarred is extremely attentive and knowledgeable.  Thanks so much!
5, My girlfriend loves this place. They have a very nice free wine sample you can try. Good pricing. I would recommend it to a friend

[WOW. That's all I can say about the food and service at this place. Not only was the food , hot , delicious and high-quality , but the service was truly fast and  exceptional. The attitude of the entire the crew was right on from start to finish that made my experience very pleasant, hospitable and comfortable. The manager surprised me by bringing the food hot and ready to me personally while I was expecting my name to be  to be called to the pick up window. Kudos Manager scott! Good job.
5, Probably should stick to Jersey.  We have so many great local sandwich shops within about a mile I don't know why anyone would indulge this crappy chain. My wife first tried it on a wine tasting trip through Edna Valley and said it was terrible, I was reluctant to believe it.  I mean sandwiches are relatively easy right?!  Wrong.  After giving this place two chances on bike rides through Edna Valley it is terrible.  The people are generally nice, hence the 2 stars.  But damn if you want an East coast sandwich drive a mile down Broad and go to the Grinder.  The sandwiches here are Subway standard maybe slightly better.  Wanted to doubt what I'd heard but turned out true.  Only reason this place might last is due to having a decent location with good employees.
2, I used to always order  the#8 sandwich off the app once, sometimes twice during the work week. There's a location a couple of miles from my office and I'd go pick it up, bring it back and have time to enjoy it on my break. The #8 comes with bacon, but for the last several visits, they've forgotten to include it. So I attempted to adjust my order and add "extra bacon" to see if that would help. That only work once and for the last 3 consecutive visits, no bacon and no extra vinegar which I always request. After these failed attempts, I gave them another try and chose a later time like 2pm for lunch pickup. Maybe it's getting forgotten during a rush. So, I went in at 215 for my 2pm pick up and not only was it not ready; it hadn't even been started; and there were no customers in line! So I sat down, checked messages, but upin near completion, of my sandwich, I had to remind them about the bacon & vinegar. This is super diappointing, because I love Jersey Mike's and am happy to pay double if it were just made correctly! I used to spend about $30 or more a week, but now, I don't even consider this location an option for a lunch break. Unless I go in on a weekend when I plenty of time to kill, I won't be returning. I've given this location many, many chances, but to no avail.
1, Best cheese steak on the Central Coast. Friendly staff and clean facility.
4, Top quality subs. Helpful staff. Meats cut fresh for each sandwich. Recommend #13 (Italian) with some pepper relish for that East Coast vibe.

[Great concept, awful execution. Really short wine list given the name of the place and doesn’t even highlight local wines. We waited 45 min and didn’t even receive the salad and olives we ordered. Food was fine, but inattentive staff and lackluster wines make this place a must-miss!
1, For a fancy place they've seriously been dropping the ball lately. The food is excellent, no question, but you have to doubt if you're going to even get what you ordered.We reserved the wine room on a Friday night for dinner for 16. They forgot that Friday night (during family weekend in a college town) might be busy.We never got our hors d'oeuvres. I had to cancel​ those after an hour after they served the mains. There was no organization all. The guys that delivered plates were great. Whoever directed them, I don't know.Everyone kept a separate tab at the wine bar because you couldn't get one at your table. (Hey Foremost, you should maybe have a whiskey or other liquor if you are going to have people standing around doing nothing waiting for nonexistent waitstaff.)That is dumb.-TBone
1, We did not get half our order and our server seemed surprised. The worst dining experience in a very long time.
1, I'm impressed. The curried cauliflower was unique and delicious and the hanger steak was great. The potatoes could have been more flavorful, but overall a great dinner.
5, Big wine bar and restaurant that has a lot of great places to sit, eat, and relax. Owned by Tooth and Nail winery but they pour other wines as well.

[Great little museum! My son LOVED it. It was only $3 to get in and totally worth it! The model train area is not complete... But as with most model train areas it will probably never be truly done! They will always be working on something! It was all decorated for Christmas so it was very pretty! Loved it!
4, Love this place would recommend for all ages very friendly very helpful The trains that they have on the tracks are pretty cool to see
5, Small that took about 30-45 mins to visit. Exhibits should be better maintained, specially when there are so few. The 1920s train car is the best exhibit, but it really need some TLC and please stop using different areas of the car as storage for old boxes.
1, Small, local RR Museum. Done a good job within the limits of their facility and funds. Focus is exclusively on the Central Coast of CA.
4, We went on a tour this Wednesday. The people who attended us were excellent. They really care for Railroad history. Thank you

[Without a doubt, this is the best movie theater in the galaxy, perhaps the entire universe.  Great staff, legendary popcorn, wonderful flicks that you won't see anywhere else, very reasonable pricing for both the movies and the goodies (which are ridiculously low priced compared to the "regular" theaters). This place is a treasure. Thank you to the owners, Jim and Patty Dee, for the this cinematic cultural oasis called the Palm Theatre!
5, It's a funky, solar powered theater. Has the best selection of movies that don't aim to be big box office hits. Try it, you'll like it.
4, Love the Palm Theatre! It's a cool old movie house where you can see a bunch of the movies that you won't find at the big franchise theatres.
5, Everybody knows the Palm Theatre has the freshest pop corn in town. What they don't know is they also have exceptional ice. Never will your frigid beverage be tainted with low quality ice at the Palm theatre. I practically go to the Palm just for those perfectly angular cubes. What a treat. Wow.
5, Love the Palm. Always great films and a nice experience talking with others , even strangers, while waiting and we don’t have to endure terrible commercials just great previews of what’s to come. Plus popcorn and drinks at a great price!

[The first time I went here, the service was so bad, and the server was just rude, but decided to try again. Second time was no better. The service here is absolutely the worst, incredibly rude staff that sits around and chats while we sit there. Don’t think of asking for anything, because they won’t bring it to you. The staff seem to have sticks up there butts, and obviously don’t want to be there. I always tip my servers, but both times were so unpleasant, both servers got nothing. I’m very easy to please but these people don’t even try. Don’t come here.
1, Came in for a late dinner. We waited for 5 minutes for someone to come and seat us finally. After seeing about 5 employees on their phone and no one come to greet us and give us a seat I decided to grab the managers card and call him. He responded by saying the take out section is closed. I told him we were not there for take out and wanted to take a seat. He responds with I will send someone instead of him coming immediately. As a restaurant owner this is unacceptable. We decided to leave. Thanks for ruining my night. I like buffalo wild wings and hope this gets fixed so it doesn't happen to other people.
1, We love wings, I love the buffalitos. I hate that every single time we eat BWW we feel sickly afterward and get diarrhea the next day. Different franchise, same results. ☹
2, Your waiter called me a “little boy” after I bought a drink athough I’m over 21. Then he actually got in my face trying to fight me after I ordered a beer. He just starting yelling at me telling me I can’t have another beer. I said okay. Then the manager said he’d call the cops if I didn’t leave. I’d just been sitting there waiting. I would definitely think twice about going to this restaraunt. Also very dirty inside
1, Very friendly service. My daughter's favorite restaurant.  I enjoyed my first visit to Buffalo Wild Wings.

[This place was highly informative. Very educational and entertaining. I was thoroughly impressed with the history of San Luis Obispo and especially enjoyed hearing the local history of the internment camps that help Japanese Americans. A video was playing in the media room but I was enthralled with all.of the pictures and displays they had. For filling out a brief survey I received a free postcard of my choosing. Plan to visit again with the family
5, This place is a gem. Highly recommend the short ten history video on the area!!!

[Great venue. Very spacious and comfortable. I have attended many shows there and have never had a bad time.
5, This venue is quite special. I enjoy the beautiful interior design & all the bands I have seen this far at the Fremont. Great local spot to see a band and meet cool people!
5, Ah, the old Fremont Theater.  What a terrible waste.   This beautiful old Art Deco beauty should be treated better than she is.  She's run down, rarely used for movies and the staff does their best with what they have (which isn't much).  The problem is the ownership.  They just don't have the money (or maybe the willpower) to fix up the old bird.  The inside is beautiful, but its decayed and derelict, which is such a shame because it's such a cool venue.  I understand there are still performances there but who uses a movie theater just for that?  As the only old theater left in the city, I think its just a shame the way it is.  I hope things change in the future.
2, Such a fun place, for kids and adults! The movies may not be Imax, and the concessions are pretty standard fare. But the experience at this theater is so special you won't even notice those things. An architectural gem too. I try to bring the whole family here once every couple months for a weekend matinee. If you haven't had the pleasure of watching a movie at the Fremont yet, definitely do so.
5, Great experience seeing Shaggy at the beautiful historic Fremont Theatre. Great acoustics for a show and the venue is an intimate setting. No matter where you are, you have a great view of the performer. Might do some good to take a couple rows of seats out as to provide more space for standing audience. Other than that, it's awesome!

[The kids area for this park was very recently remodeled. It is absolutely fantastic now. There are great big play structures with many slides and multiple stories. There is a zipline. Bring some old cardboard to slide down the fake grass hill slide.
5, The new best spot in Slo for active parent/child play! Multiple interactive structures and activities, lots of room even when busy, very clean and safe. Also good central location. Water fountains are filtered water and one even specifically for filling water bottles, very parent friendly park. Zip line, climbing stuff, best slides around town, multiple garbage cans around and tables, we have 3 boys and would recommend this to all. Leaving out a bunch too, go check it out!
5, GREAT park!! There is something for everyone here. If you get the chance check it out,  best park in the area!
5, Fun little park with a surprising amount of stuff to do! You can easily lose a couple hours there with kids.
5, This park was fabulous! They have a artificial grass turf hill to sleddown. There's plenty of cardboard to use as a slide at the park, however if you want to prepare a superslider at home with built in handles that would be awesome! Three turny twisty slides for big kids or brave adults and a couple smaller slides for smaller kids. They also have a zip line!! Im proposing a designated adult park day, lol. It would be awesome during the weekdays for homeschool park days. Enjoy!

[Little-known and secluded, this arboretum is perennially quiet. The perfect place to unwind after classes, or relax before a new week.
5, It's a wonderful garden that's free to visit. Its tucked away and parking is only free on the weekends or with a cal poly permit but it's GORGEOUS.
5, Never even got a chance to go in, it was closed off. This is located inside the college campus. I'm not entirely sure it's actually open to the public.
1, Great place for a date, tons of beautiful plant life 
5, It was a wonderful afternoon walk

[Pretty straight up,  strenuous trail.  Great hike from this entrance though. Probably not best trailhead for small kids but it's doable.  Took me about 40 minutes at slow comfortable pace. 
4, It's a bit awkward getting in and out  (especially out) of what's basically just a slight turnout on the side of a fairly busy road. The hike itself is great but parking here isn't the best.
3, Great hike,  not too strenuous, but invigorating. 
5, Love this place. 
5, Really, this is the only (and by only, I mean best) place to park when hiking Bishop's.

[The park has a large grass area, a baseball field, basketball courts, picnic tables. There are public bathrooms right next to the little kids play area. There is a nice structure for playing on. This is also a great skatepark. There is a large area specifically for skateboarding and tricks.
5, I go here often.  They have a great playground for kids.  A bathroom during hours.  Lots of grass for dogs and people to hang out.  A horseshoe pit, roller rink, basketball courts, baseball fields, soccer fields, and an amazing skatepark.
5, 11/10 met the best boy. He was a pretty floof and very well behaved.
4, Park for all types. Open grassy areas, a playground, skate park, and even an inline hockey rink with a seemless surface.

[too focused on the contributions of R. E. Jack rather than life in a Victorian home. Also... not much in the way of furnishings. Because each room was given to a local professional interior decorator to refurbish the house lacks a authentic uniform style. I like the way the docents dress up a la late 1800s!
3, Beautiful setting near downtown. Well kept. 
4, Beautiful area. We had our wedding here. Reasonably priced and quick with the deposit refund. Just know that you are responsible for all the set up and breakdown.

4, Great park with lots of space, swings, 2 play structures for different age groups, tennis courts, a basketball court, lots of picnic tables. There are bathrooms and off street parking.
5, Wonderful place to play pickleball. Friendly people and good play🎶
5, French Park is a great place to take the kids to play on the playground, but I take away one start for the volumes of dog poo that I find in the grass.  A little gross, really.

[Big Park and great for walking, biking,jogging,. They have a basketball court and a volleyball court to! Great for parties and out door grills and I've seen people have birthday parties inside so you can rent that space as well. Way to many guys though. Oh well it's fun to chill in the sun regardless. 
5, Nice Basketball court and awesome park for walking around in the trees...and,a sand volleyball court....
4, Very nice park with a lot of options for everyone. Great perk over other parks are the paths that stretch through the neighborhood along the creek (or drainage path). Would be fine stars if the large playground had more traditional items (slide or swing), also there can be homeless hanging out more than other parks. None of those will keep me away
4, Great park. Lots of amenities. Good paths. Great grass.
5, Nice park with nice walking or biking trails.

[Great 1.5 hour hike to the top and back down. If you start at the Marsh St parking area there is a sign showing some trails. This sign doesn't have the trail going to the top. I think it is just for the area managed by the city. If you want to go to the top from marsh st parking, when you get to the trees three is a trail over a bridge going to the right at a sign with a M on it. Go to the left at that sign. (Going to the right is a short hike to the big letter M.) You'll soon duck under a bar gate. Continue on the single track to the next gate and go through the small gate. Stay on the main road to the top. 
5, Really nice hike, run or ride! Great for watching the sunset or seeing the city lights at night.
4, Great hiking spot
5, This is one of the most popular hikes in  SLO.  The trail  can get a bit steep at times, but once you get to the top you are rewarded with the most amazing 360 degree view of San Luis Obispo. 
5, Beautiful. Great views and a decent hike.

[I appreciate that Kelsey was patient with me and my situation with relevance to winter, door size, screen size - I have a really weirdly constructed door and a rather fat cat named Mia.  Kelsey came up with a great idea for me which I will use for the winter, and another idea for summer, and it is very economical.  This is an excellent company!
5, At 1st I thought it was a little expensive but once I easily installed it and saw how well it was built and the  I was  more than impressed.    Even fast delivery.  Thank you
5, I placed an order online and then sent an e-mail to change it before shipping. Thet actually called and helped fix my order so I could get the parts I needed.
5, There doors are the best you can get and a great value.

[Delicious Thai food with pretty generous portions. The chicken is very tangy and flavorful. What I appreciate was that they were one of a very limited number of restaurants open on a holiday. It was nice to get a good quality meal at a time I might have settled for McDonalds.
5, This place is excellent. It's very rare that I use that word to describe restaurants but this is one of, if not, the best Thai restaurant I've been to. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, the service is good and the food is fantastic! I highly recommend stopping by this place for dinner
5, All three of our party noted it was some of the best Thai food they've had -- Yellow curry, Pad Thai (tofu), and Cashew Nut (tofu). Server was pleasant, too.
5, This place had good food and attentive service. Everyone was pleasant and respectful. I will be back.
5, The service was fast and our server was very pleasant. The food was great. I had the Shitaki and Green with Jasmine rice. The coconut soup was amazing, loaded with veggies and just enough heat to make it great. I'd come back just for the soup it was so good.

[Linger, I'm a parent that's been with the school nearly from the beginning. your assessment of the administration not leading by example is laughable. we all understand that the school isn't for everyone, perhaps you included. you are wrong to write such nonsense in a public forum. your comments are inaccurate, indefensible, misinformed, and outlandish.following up, Linger...whoops! did you not notice the lesbian couples whose kids attend our school? the non-believers? the folks who go to church elsewhere? lots of those folks are coming back, too. new families are joining us. the application process is incomplete, but it looks certain that attendance will be up from last year. I didn't bother stating my own opinion about the school since it was implied by my family's continued commitment to the school that we love it. we love that those lesbians and non-believers and other church attenders love it too. and they do. they are all our friends, and I love it that they are our friends. I'm honored that they call me their friend.I am truly sad the school didn't work for you. indeed I am. but in seeing your willingness to defame the school, I also am happy to declare to the world on this review that you really have little idea of which you speak.the floor is yours. I'll give you the last word & let others decide if they should or should not look into our school. I'm biased toward our school and my ability to persuade...I believe I am in the lead on this one.
5, San Luis Obispo Classical Academy is where I wish I had gone to school. With such a loving staff and driven curriculum, SLOCA is a community that forges character, fosters wisdom, and nurtures a lifelong passion for learning.
5, A very unique school- great school, great books, great kids, great teachers!  This school combines school and homeschool.  The kids go to school two days a week and I get to homeschool them the other 3 days! The class sizes are small, only 12 kids per class.  My children love it and are thriving.  We are lucky to have such an option on the Central Coast!
5, Terrible administration with no one leading by example. They consistently make hasty choices without parent and teacher feedback. What began as a beautiful idea is now crumbling. School has gotten too much of an EGO and has forgotten their way. Instead of driving children to love learning, they are cramming over-the-top, highly cerebral curriculum down their throats. They have also done away with their anti-bully model and allow terrible things to happen to other children without recourse. Great teachers do happen to be here if you're lucky enough to get one that has stayed on for more than 2 years. The turn around is ridiculous. My child had two new teachers come in mid-year two years in a row! Parents are exhausted with all that is being asked of them and now they decide to raise tuition? Crazy!@Bischbubba: Apparently, the review tool of this public forum whizzed by your comprehension. From my understanding it is completely fair and valuable for me to give my honest feedback of this school. In fact, as a classical educating parent at SLOCA, you should already know the context from where the word "forum" is derived from. If not, let me jog your mind...Ancient Greece and Rome...the 6th. century BCE...Aristotle, Socrates, Plato? It's interesting to me that you would find my opinion wrong or invaluable. I can only thank you for sharing your opinion and be glad that this school worked out for you. I thank you also for reinforcing with your rhetoric exactly the kind of egocentric baloney that goes in tandem with SLOCA. It seems as though this school is beginning to unravel. However, I'm sure it can survive as a perfect school for cookie-cutter, same church going, narrow thinking individuals. Heaven forbid you have an opinion or thought of your own to share!

[We live in the neighborhood and this is one of our favorite spots for lunch or dinner.  Not fancy but just good clean well made Japanese food. Noodle bowls, rolls, tempura, udon, it's all good.Edit:We ate there again over the weekend, actually take-out sushi, and it was excellent, as always.  It is a minor thing on the menu but the seaweed salad is terrific, simple and tasty.
5, My husband actually ate here and got full, which never happens because he's so stupid picky. Awesome place to get food.
5, I am blown away by the reviews on here.  After eating this food I came back to the page to check the reviews thinking, "I should have read the reviews first."  Blow away by the GREAT reviews because I found the food seriously lacking in flavor.  Japanese food is known to have great and powerful flavors, this just didn't.  Very, VERY bland and disappointing.  Portions were pretty good and price was just right.  However, even with that, I will never go back.  It was that bad.  😝
1, The food was fine but the restaurant is having a major identity crisis. One wall is blue, another green, red, etc. Classical music was being played over the speakers. Random paintings on the walls. Oh, and there's a large chandelier hanging in the middle of the place.
4, Great small sushi place that has reasonable food with reasonable prices! Loved the sushi bowl for $9.95 add some siracha with a miso soup. And its amazing.

[Mike, the owner, is the kindest man who will work endlessly to find you what you need. What an awesome place to shop at, with prices that beat pretty much anywhere online. Their selection is great, and they are the definition of a well run family owned business.
5, I went to a Chiropractor that showed me my shoes were part of my cause of hip and back pain. He recommended Mike's Shoes to get a pair of walking shoes for my job. The service was above and beyond any shoe place I have ever been to in my 57yrs of life. The knowledge and recommendation for footwear was wonderful. I replaced all my shoes in my house with new shoes that work for my body. NO MORE PAIN in my hips or back like before came down to proper shoes, with the help of the staff at Mike's shoes in SLO
5, Best shoe store ever! The quality of all the shoes is excellent, the value is excellent, and the service is even beyond excellent. My daughter and I were there for two hours, and throughout all the salespeople were not only helpful and courteous and knowledgeable, but truly delightful, supportive and kind. I also very much appreciate that Mike's Shoes carries Israeli made shoes - thank you! That really matters to me as a Jew, especially in these times!  I will be back every time I  have shoe needs because I have never shopped in a better store!
5, Excellent service. Sales girl was exceptionally helpful. Great quality shoes. Would definitely recommend. 
5, A family business that has a personal interest in helping the folks in Slo get quality shoes. Very good sale rack

[Great tasting barbecue.  We ordered the tri tip and ribs and was not disappointed. Very flavorful and tender. Homemade barbecue sauces were good. Homemade ranch was excellent. Friendly staff. A little bit of a wait, but worth it.
5, Food is amazing. Decor and atmosphere doesn't match. It could use some upgrades. Years ago I had tons of fun here and it's exactly the same. 
3, The food is really good and the people that work there are very friendly
5, OM-G Brothers!!!  This place is amazing!!  I had the pork burrito and everything about it was perfect!  My husband had the brisket and eggs and the brisket was tender and delicious.  We will definitely be back when we pass through town!!  Very easy access off the highway too.
5, Portions have gotten smaller than they used to be, other then that awesome food!Best ranch and barbecue sauce around

[One of the best restaurants in the vicinity. Whenever we go to SF while coming back we definitely have our lunch or dinner here. They have good choices of vegetarian and chicken items and how spicy you want is customizable.food orders are quick and waiters do an awesome job. . Definitely a must eat restaurant.
4, Love their food. The  Nan bread is really good. They offer vegetarian and non vegetarian choices and Chai tea is included with lunch.
5, This place is great! We went with a big group for my daughter's birthday and everyone had good things to say about their meals. Prices are very reasonable too. Will definitely be back.
5, Good service, good food.  There aren't any warnings as to what is spicey or not,  so be careful if you can't stand the heat...but all the food is awesome.   My kids kept going back for the spinach curry.
5, I loved the food, The service, and the general look of the dining area. The food has its wait times, but that is to make sure that the food is in top shape. i loved every aspect about it and would dine here every week.

[Portions are enormous!  Pig sandwich was great - and huge, side order of fries is enough for 4 people :)  The beans are very tasty but they were barely warm.  No one in our party liked the coleslaw and couldn't figure out what was in it that gave it the funky taste.  Service was good the restaurant was clean.
4, They make great burgers and tri-tip sandwiches. It can get very busy at peak times, but they do have a lot of outside seating as well as their indoor tables. You order and pay and are given a number on your receipt. Your number is called and you pick up your food. They also have a bar and areas where they do table service instead of ordering first before sitting down. I have found the tables to be dirty more often than not.
4, The steak sandwich is amazing. The steak Cobb salad is also great. They also have burgers and beers. Atmosphere is chill but can be a bit loud. Especially during important sporting events.
4, Great food. Large burgers, sandwiches, salads. Everything is freshly grilled with fast service so you can eat right away. Firestone is very popular, and it gets pretty crowded, so arrive early if you want to dine inside. Otherwise, their patio is good for very large groups.
5, One of the local favorites of San Luis Obispo. Great cheeseburgers made over a wood burner and they are really known for having some awesome fries (they come a little on the salty side, but that's how I like them). Service is always fast, polite and anything that ever was wrong was immediately made right. Expect to be in a crowded restaurant and good luck trying to get a seat during farmers market. But otherwise ample indoor and outdoor seating with a large bar area.

[Good Food. Had the Fresno Fig Burger and it was Delicious!! The Fig Marmalade was fantastic. Very clean and well organized. Good beer selection. And very friendly staff. Visiting from out of state.... I will.be back.
5, Great location and vibe to go along with the food and alcohol selection. Awesome for whiskey and beer, and the bartenders are good at their drinks. Maybe the food isn't the best bang for your buck, but I'll always say yes to going. The bison and bone marrow burgers are a must
4, Taking the American kitchen to the next level. Fig preserves bacon burger "out of this world", chicken nachos could use more authentic flavors,  and kids menu interesting.  Service was quick and friendly.  Relaxed atmosphere with a variety of old rock playing in the background.
4, SO. GOOD. Burgers are absolutely fantastic. The fries are awesome as well. I'd heavily recommend the Fig and Goat Cheese burger. Tastes so good (even if you don't like goat cheese all that much)
5, Best restaurant experience! Not only were the staff exceptionally nice and genuine the food was extremely flavorful and exceeded all my expectations. We met the manger briefly and he bought us a dessert to end the night. If you don’t like good food, this is not the place for you.

[Perfect place for authentic Thai food and hospitality.  The front of the house staff as well as the kitchen offer customers with welcoming smiles and a very familial ambiance.  Thai Boat has definitely made a customer for life.
5, Great food. Great staff. Everyone was friendly. Seating is close together but works. Makes it feel more family oriented. The menu is extensive. Alot of different foods to try. We had the fried wontons, chicken green curry and the Pa Nang chicken curry. Both excellent! Will definitely be back.
5, they are so nice.  they are closed on weekends.  they also randomly are closed.  I love the garlic noodles.
5, One the best places I have eaten in SLO hands down! The best customer service and the food is amazing. Gets busy at lunch time so plan ahead if you are planning to eat there.
5, My partner and I always love coming to the Thai boat for three reasons, we always have a place to sit and eat, the food is phenomenal and you are helped by some of the friendliest people on the Central Coast.

[The ppl working (especially the guy) working that night was incredible...mom and I had low blood sugars, were exhausted, and he just understood the urgency I had to get mom and I feed. He made our sandwiches perfectly and was patient with my fuzzy brain (due to low sugar). Only subway I have been to bc this was my 1st trip to Santa Barbara, SLO and Santa Maria. I appreciate his kindness and patience the most! I always appreciate Subways that carry the veggie patty/veggie max. Thanks to this employee who helped us that night!
5, I like Subway.  Great value.  I just say "LOTS of everything".  I wind up with a sandwich that is a huge salad with some deli slices.  Love it.
4, Always courteous.  They are patient, even if you're a little slow making up your mind about what you want.  They are helpful with coupons.  Food is always fresh. I like seeing the calorie count on the menu board.
5, Bad service bad everything all the way around horrible people drug addicts
1, The best Subway in town. Better than Jersey Mike's even!

[Been going here since I was a kid. I feel the quality has diminished overtime however it's still one of the closest pizza places to us and it's convenient when down town! Why can't the dough support the cheese and toppings, even when on thick or well done crust? If you try to grab a slice you end up leaving your cheese and toppings behind laying in the box. Salads are good! Chicken wings good! Ranch can get super salty
2, Nice relaxed pizza place.  I had pizza and an antipasto salad and they were both good.  The place has the typical pizza place atmosphere which is what I was looking for.  The staff was nice and the place was very clean.  Definitely would go back.
4, Food is pretty good.  If you want a delivery, you have to buy at least $50 worth of food.  The alternative was to go into the restaurant which I did the time before and waited in line for 30 min, even though I called in my order.  So if you are patient, the pizza is good and you will like it.  If you are in a hurry or want a small delivery, think about somewhere else.
2, Woodstock's was a favorite of mine when I lived in SLO, and it's still great all these years later.  Bonus points for having hands-down the best gluten-free crust I've ever had to date.  Friendly staff, flavorful toppings, and all kinds of entertainment to watch.
5, Great pizza and fast service. The place is very clean all the time; a lot of employees keep coming around and picking up the stuff from the tables.

[This place is fantastic! Very friendly service and amazing food! The manager waited on us and the entire staff couldn't have been more professional and friendly. I would have to say that this place ranks in the top 5 best dining experiences ever! Anything on the menu is incredible, the entire staff  were speaking fluently in Italian, it doesn't get much closer to Northern Italy without being there!
5, This place is awesome. Everything we had was cooked perfectly and the dessert was amazing. There was a special for 3 course meal that was totally awesome. If you like Italian food you will love this place.
4, Feels like home with food even better than Nonna's, friendly service, great wine list and always interesting and delicious specials.
5, This is the best Italian restaurant in San Luis Obispo. The food is exceptional albeit a bit pricey. They have a wonderful patio out back and you want to make sure you sit in it. If you want a festive romantic night out this is the place to go. Lunches are a little more affordable with similar food so that's an option if budget is more of a concern for you.
5, Such great food and romantic patio. Very reasonable lunch prices around $14 per plate! Friendly service and love the Piedmont will e list and imported cheeses for full Italy experience.

[All of our teachers work very hard to insure the fun and safety of our children while making sure they have a memorable learning experience.
5, Our 6 year old went to Foothill until he was just under 5 years old. It was great the teachers where so kind and with Cal Poly ECE students working they developed great ways to teach the kids every week. He loved it there.We now have a 1 year old going as well. The teachers are great and he loves going. I would highly recommend this school to anyone. It is hard to get into so keep that in mind.
5, Our daughter went her a few years ago and we loved it so after we adopted our 2nd child we called and secured our son a spot.  Wow how times have changed.  Ella seems like she is checked out and just doesn't care anymore and the teachers complain about doing their jobs and act like they are doing you a major favor by doing even their basic job.   Every day last week I was called to pick my child up early, each day for a different stupid excuse.  Why am I paying them if they just send him home for being a 2 year old boy.  Answer is that as of today we aren't, we found someone who actually wants to do the job we are paying them for.
2, I would not recommend this school. I was a teacher in the infant room and was appalled at how the babies were not given the attention they deserved. The facility was dirty and and toys on  the playground were not safe. Unfortunately, the director was not open to my suggestions and would not hire more staff so that teachers could provide quality care to the children.
1, As a parent I feel it's my responsibility to inform other parents of our experience at this daycare/preschool.  Our little 2 year old was injured on his second day of daycare at this school.  We do not know how it happened because the supervisors on staff all claimed to had not seen him fall & we were never notified when his head began to swell (due to the injury).  I picked him up promptly after my workday ended and I found him with a swollen head (horrifyingly-so, in my opinion as his mother).  I called it to the attention of his teacher and asked her what happened.  It seemed like it was the first time she was noticing that he looked odd.  After asking a bunch of questions about if he fell, or if he was bit by a spider (which she did confirm they had a problem with), or what he ate, I rushed down the street to the ER at Sierra Vista.After waiting quite a while in the ER to get seen we finally had a CT scan done and it turned out he had a skull fracture and a subdural hematoma.  After all this, I have to say we were very lucky that he was not fatally or permanently injured.  The police & CPS were both notified and are conducting their investigation of the childcare facility.  While we as parents recognize and accept that accidents happen (especially with toddlers), it is our responsibility to also inform other parents so they can provide the best care for their children.  I really believe the school didn't intentionally hurt our baby, but he was also unsupervised and even neglected (to the degree that they didn't see his head swelling) for some time.Please help spread the word to anyone who is going to or thinking about going to this preschool.Thanks!P.S. My son's accident took place on Sept. 2nd, 2010

[Were you actually charged the $150 without the shoes being shipped. If you were charged you should be able to get your order number from the receipt and then contact the company with the order number. It would be easier to track down the order that way. I would be curious to know if you ever got your shoes.

Anyway it was definitely a pleasure meeting & speaking with her. Shoe Palace is very lucky to have her. No doubt I'd shop there again. The rest of the staff was great as well. It's obvious they share the same values as Ariel, regarding customer service.Update:Went back the next day & bought the shiznits!

When I needed a heel repair a while back, a friend recommended Takken's and I called them and even though their cobbler wasn't going to be able to get the repair done in the time I needed (it was totally my fault waiting until 2 days before the event) they were happy to suggest other places that may be less booked and able to get the repair done by the time I needed it. It was a life saver. Thank you Takken's!
5, Very disappointing visit. Wanted to return an item bought there, but store manager said he didn't sell this item, although they were clearly on the shelf. Poor customer service. No attempt toale it right.

5, Way crowded! A lot of rich college kids
3, An uncrowded small shopping center near me.
4, This small "hidden" mall appeals more to the Cal-Poly U crowd (students & staff), but it also can appeal to others.  The main anchor store, which is a Lassen's Market (an upscale gourmet/ health food market), boasts a good healthy hot/cold bar.  There are a range of other stores here as well. These range from a Credit Union, to fast food, to a bar/restaurant, to a coffee shop, to a gym, to a Rite Aid, and more.  All in all, a good pit-siop for those who work in the area, or are passing by on Hwy # 1....there is nothing like this on the 1 for the next few hundred miles...until you get to Carmel!!!
5, Lots of stores to offer!

[Not much there. Good I guess because it's not crowded, but I don't think SLO wants something like this. Loses its small town feel.
2, A really big strip mall with a lot of parking and room for larger vehicles. A very good selection of stores and restaurants. The property is well kept, has very good lighting at night. Have also seen security patrols around the parking lot.  There is also an Embassy suites hotel in the back of the property .
5, A great lounge with excellent acoustics. Not loud even though it is full of people. Super bar food.
5, A run down ghost town of a shopping center, calling it a "mall" is comical at best. The businesses that remain, ($$ Store, Payless Shoes, Bed Bath and Beyond... ) are staffed by a predictable collection of individuals who boast having mastered both apathy and downright abusiveness. To be able to juggle both traits simultaneously takes true talent - a talent I have seen demonstrated enough for one lifetime.
1, Convenient freeway access. Lots of easy parking for trailers and RVs.  Good food options in the immediate area.

[Very impressed with the level of professionalism all of your employees exhibit! Great prices and amazing massage just what I needed! Only thing that would have made it perfect is if the guy I had today around 1p didn't burp and grunt while I was giving the massage! Enjoyed the techniqes and private room. Will be back!
5, This was just an absolutely unbelievable 30 minute massage I called up and they took me immediately when my back hurt. They were so nice and helpful and it was a very relaxing quiet atmosphere even though it's right next-door to a 7-Eleven.
5, Fantastic, inexpensive Chinese massage parlor. I got a 60 minute foot massage that included a great neck, shoulder, and scalp massage while my feet were soaking, and again during the last 5 or 10 minutes of the session. For only $35! It's very nicely maintained, the people working there are nice, and prices unbeatable.  I highly recommend this place, and will be back
5, Not bad. I went in to get an  accupunture massage as listed on their menu, but instead I received a deep tissue massage that was good, but it wasn't what I've asked for.
3, Now that I something to compare it to.. Nice and quiet. Private room. Very good massage. I would recommend to anyone. Much better than another place I went to today.

[This is probably one of the most fun massage therapists that I've ever had (I'm a chatty type, tho she does respect it when you get quiet). Annie is what I would call a naturopathic massage therapist. She uses all natural essential oils, some of which are very expensive, and tries to focus on which oils will be best for you, as an individual. If you enjoy all the smells of Massage, you're going to love her. The massage I had was relaxing and she was very professional throughout. She has more than 20 years of experience. For those of you who are interested in a massage therapist's pressure or style when reading a review: I was really surprised that I feel just as good as, if not better than, when I get a sports massage style masseuse. I didn't know a massage didn't have to hurt you in order to make you feel relief from knots and tightness. Went to see her because I was having severe cervical neck pain. I don't really buy into the whole fufu hippie 'oils will heal your body' thing--because science--but I do believe in the physiological evidence for massage and Annie has a gift for it. I'm not sore at all and I barely felt discomfort while she was working out knots (honestly, I didn't think she applied enough pressure, but maybe it was the muscle relaxing oil because, wow. ). She wrapped up my massage with a lymphatic drainage. I'm in a lot less pain today than I've been in a month and I'm finally starting to feel more like myself again. Thank you, Annie! Oh, and her rates are very reasonable. I can't afford most massage therapists, but I can afford Annie. I did a 90-minute.
5, Annie was wonderful. My husband and I went to her for a couple's massage. I had a recent car accident in September, and she was so considerate of my particular tender spots on my neck and back. She was thorough and gentle. I felt the most relaxed than I have ever felt before after the massage, I will be definitely going to her again soon
5, Great experience, knowledgeable and informative
5, Annie Laurie is the best! Hands down the most intuitive and effective healer in the region. Her holistic approach to whole body therapy is amazing and what makes her standout.  
5, Fantastic!I received a massage from her then decided to get a chiropractic back adjustment from dr. Backmann, who luckily fit me in spur of the moment, and I can say that I have gone 5 months back pain free using this combo!

Applied exactly my preferred pressure/style.  Afterwards, I actually had to just sit and hang out for a bit in my car, as I was in such a post-massage super chill blissed out state!  I will definitely book again.

[I would have given the hotel 2.5 stars because the beds were comfortable, the towels we're nice and it was fairly quiet. The website states it's a non smoking environment. People above us smoked cigarettes on their balcony every half hour or so then threw the butts on the grass area. Because of that we were unable to open our sliding glass door to air out the room which smelled of too much cleaner. Also, right outside our sliding door was an accumulation of many cig butts. The smell of cigarettes was everywhere. Because of that we will never stay here again. Our TV kept malfunctioning though front staff quickly came to try and fix.
2, Nice place off Hwy 101. Needed a place to stay, the staff were very accommodating. Fast check in w/o a reservation. Breakfast included. Will be staying there again
5, I had a great stay at this clean, friendly, and quiet motel. They offer a continental breakfast oh and indoor room entrances I really loved. The carpet made me feel right at home. Swimming pool And Spa to sooth those aches and pains at the end of a hard day, what more could you ask for...I give it a cool 5 stars!!!!
5, For $60 a night this place is totally worth it good accommodation good cable with all the channels and the best part the two queen beds were super comfortable the showers are great the pool is nice the spa is fantastic and you're nearby a lot of great restaurants and downtown San Luis Obispo I will definitely make this place my go-to when I'm in the Coast.

5, This is by far the BEST salon I have ever been to! I have been to both locations, and all stylists (I've had 3) are professional, nice, and very skilled. They fixed my hair after a botched home dye job and gave me the exact color I wanted (I literally pointed to a girl on the street and they matched the color!). They also know how to cut curly hair (which anyone with curly hair knows how hard it is to find a stylist that can do this!). I would recommend this salon to anyone and everyone. Plus, I think their prices are very fair. They also use Aveda products, which are naturally derived- cool, right?! I have never trusted salons before salon lux (again, curly hair) but am looking forward to my next visit. 
5, Great Salon, friendly staff, and yummy tea or coffee is complimentary. Kelsey is a wonderful stylist!

[I really enjoy the studio I am in. It's very quiet and close to campus which is a big plus. The laundry rooms, however, could be better. It's very humid and crowded in there, with very little space to move around in order to take care of clothing. Most of the machines have mold in them, which is a health hazard to all tenants who use the machines. I've visited to laundry sites and they all have the same issues. The mold issue is a problem because the users close the door right after washing (allowing the hot water to cause bacteria to grow). If maintenance could perhaps clean the washers often, that would be great. Dryers are fine since they are hot and dry (evidently) which prevent bacterial growth. Other than that, Mustang is great for the price and location. The pools are well maintained, the study room is great, and I can't appreciate how quiet it is where I am (in the back near the stadium).
5, They are always trying to over charge me and I have to fight with them every time to get my money back. I already switched my electricity over to PG&E and mustang is still trying to charge me for that too. The apartments are alright but be prepared to fight in order to not get ripped off.
1, Awful!My roommates and I spent all of winter quarter dealing with an issue that should have been resolved relatively quickly if proper procedure had been followed from the start. Right when we returned from winter break, we came home to find our apartment flooded. They came and mopped it, but did nothing to prevent the issue from happening again. The second time it flooded they mopped once more and started talking about what they could do to solve it, but did nothing until the third time it flooded which was the worst time. Our entire apartment was covered with at least an inch of water. Don't get me wrong, the maintenance people are really nice and try their best to solve the issues, but it was obviously a task that should be handled by a professional. We got put up in a hotel for two nights, while they dried out our apartment and put new floors in. In typical Mustang Village fashion, they laid new floor over the old floor. Us being college students with no construction background at all could tell you that wasn't going to work, because the old flooring was cheap and absolutely soaked through. The flooding problem was eventually fixed, but a few days later we found mold all along our wall. Again, they didn't bring in professionals but just had their maintenance team try to handle the task.They knocked down the wall and put a new one up. Unsurprisingly, the mold came back. They were about to just knock down the wall again when we called in a city health inspector, who finally got them to listen, and they finally brought in professional. As you must do with mold, they blocked off much of our lower portion of our apartment to dry out the walls, which finally solved the problem. The professionals also found out about the flooring and thought it was ridiculous that they had just installed the new floors over the old floors. Random funny anecdote, the health inspector taped a notice on our door that they had to deal with the mold issue and the manager GAVE US A VANDALISM CITATION!!!Anyway, the manager Justin Epperly is a complete asshole, who will not try to work with you to solve issues, and will lie to you about how much money he will give you so that you can stay in a hotel while they try to fix the issue for the umpteenth time. If you don't have to deal with management or any major construction issues, maybe you'll be fine. I don't know, but I sure as hell would advise you not to come near Mustang Village.
1, This place is literally the worst. Unfortunately I lived here for 2 years due to its close proximity to campus. That's the only good thing about this place. Rude staff. Parking is impossible. Thin walls, thin floors, unbelievably noisy. It's torture sometimes. They also raised my rent in just TWO years from 750/month to 1,045/month. Again, I cannot emphasize enough just how rude and unresponsive their staff is. Never live here.
1, I was very disappointed by the state of disrepair in our apartment upon move-in. In addition to small scratches and dings around the unit, here were the most major problems that all existed before we arrived:- Broken dishwasher.- AC broken, and upon repair was noisy as it sprayed dust and rocks out the window.- 20ft deep clog in toilet (we found out this was the problem after maintenance snaked it).- Refrigerator covered in small dents on front, with back grate broken and wires spilling out. One day it turned off and we had to fiddle with the wires to get it working again.- Our unit was the only Townhome with carpeting downstairs, and it appeared to be covering an odd lump under the floor. There was a small nail protruding from beneath the edge of the carpet just far enough to poke a foot and snag on socks. This also made cleaning a lot harder because we planned for a hardwood floor with a non-carpet vacuum.- Lots of dust beneath all of the beds, as if the cleaning crew had barely slept over there surface and just ignored all of the places that were hard to reach. - One of the bulbs in the kitchen was burned out, making our apartment very dim, especially in combination with the dark carpet.- There were holes torn in the backs of both couches.Because more things seemed to be broken than in good condition upon move-in, I have a very low opinion of Mustang. In addition, there have been incidents where they accidentally billed for an extra month that affected several renters. I do not look forward to move out, because I would not be surprised if they try to charge me claiming I broke all of the aforementioned appliances. Other people were less unlucky than us, but be aware that it can be as bad as our experience.

[Thank you to the parents who send their friendly, happy, respectful children to CalPoly. For the most part they are good for the town and neighborhoods. I miss them in the summer, and welcome the excitement when they return in the fall. This, of course only applies to the friendly, happy, respectful students!! 😊
5, Beautiful campus.  We always have a pleasant experience every time to visit the campus.  From students to staffs are so friendly and courteous.
5, Lack of support for the students is ridiculous. Students should be allowed to enroll in the classes they need. Cal Poly needs to hire more professors so students can graduate on time. This is an issue that needs to be addressed. An issue, that is long over due.
1, slo library talking Charle's Dill 5 stages of becoming short supply pilots end of 1943 not the 8000 lost USS Navy ignored the history missin 5-Star's Johnny's dad had to rescue them Cal-poly I flew I'm Silver Wings kneel before a GOD!!.

[In comparison with UCLA's famous dining hall, Cal Poly dining has a ways to go, but compared to the average college dining, Cal Poly dining has a decent selection of both recognizable brands and campus brands, offering both healthy selection such as a full salad bar and indulgence selection like burgers and burritos. Pricing is towards the high end, especially considering most identical menus just off campus are easily 15-25% cheaper. Service speed could use improvemt but considering the number of students it must serve daily and the mainly student based work force, it gets a pass.I don't see much faculty dining here, which can be a telltale for the overall sentiment towards dining hall. Food quality is decent overall, slightly above fast food quality, but not quite at a food truck level yet. There is a reasonable change in menu selection from year to year, with the essentials such as salads, sandwiches, and hamburgers remaining more or less the same.
4, Never left a negative review in my life but both the quality and the food itself is bad. Every time I come here, my stomach feels greasy and turny for at least till the next morning. This place should undergo health inspection, from the plates and cups looking half washed.
1, You would honestly have to put a concentrated effort to make food across an entire campus so uniformly bad and expensive. You'd think with all their money they could afford to provide something other than this garbage.
1, Cool place to hang out with friends and have a quick bite to eat on the way to classes.
3, literal trash
